This taxonomic analysis provides essential insights for system designers and researchers, establishing that optimal WiFi sensing requires leveraging strengths of both approaches rather than relying on single-system solutions.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Fundamental System Architecture Analysis

**CSI vs PWR Working Mechanisms**: The paper provides comprehensive analysis of fundamental operational differences between CSI and PWR systems. CSI systems function as extensions of WiFi communications, utilizing channel estimation between transmitter and receiver to extract amplitude and phase information from preamble sequences. In contrast, PWR systems operate as radar systems, correlating transmitted WiFi signals with reflected signals from surveillance areas to calculate relative distance and velocity information.

**Mathematical Signal Processing Framework**: Both systems process OFDM WiFi signals defined as:

```
x(t) = (1/√N) Σ(n=1 to N) aₙe^(j2πnt/Ts)                    (1)
y(t) = Σₚ Aₚe^(j2πfdt) x(t - τ) + n(t)                     (2)
```

where N represents subcarrier count, aₙ denotes constellation symbols, Aₚ, τ, fd represent attenuation, delay, and Doppler shift for the p-th path. The CSI signal H(fc,t) = Y(fc,t)/X(fc,t) provides channel response, while PWR systems utilize Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) for range-Doppler analysis.

**Temporal and Frequency Domain Utilization**: Critical architectural differences emerge in signal utilization patterns. CSI systems process only preamble portions of WiFi packets, ignoring data signals but providing fine-grained subcarrier analysis. PWR systems capture entire WiFi signals including data portions and time gaps, treating complete OFDM symbols as unified signals without individual subcarrier processing capabilities.

### Advanced Signal Processing Methodologies

**CSI Signal Processing Pipeline**: The CSI system implements sophisticated three-stage processing: (1) Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) denoising with median filtering to remove high-frequency noise while preserving activity-related components, (2) Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction from 90k complex values per second (1×3×30×1k) to five principal components capturing 70-80% signal variance, (3) Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) conversion to Doppler spectrograms using sliding windows.

**PWR Signal Processing Architecture**: The PWR system employs Cross Ambiguity Function analysis for range-Doppler surface generation, implemented using low-complexity CAF formulation:

```
CAF(τ,fd) = ∫₀^Tᵢ x(t)y*(t-τ)e^(j2πfdt)dt                  (4)
```

The system incorporates CLEAN algorithm for direct signal interference cancellation and Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) for noise reduction, enabling real-time processing capabilities.

**Geometric Sensitivity Analysis**: The study reveals fundamental geometric dependencies affecting system performance. Three layout configurations demonstrate distinct performance characteristics:
- **Layout 1 (Forward Scatter/LoS)**: 180° transmitter-object-receiver alignment favors CSI systems
- **Layout 2 (Bistatic)**: 90° geometry provides balanced performance for both systems
- **Layout 3 (Monostatic)**: <45° alignment optimizes PWR system performance

### Experimental Validation and Comparative Analysis

**Comprehensive Hardware Implementation**: The experimental setup implements both systems concurrently using Intel 5300 NIC for CSI collection and USRP-2921 SDR for PWR analysis. The 3m×3m monitoring area accommodates five subjects performing six activity classes: walking, sitting, standing from chair, laying down, standing from floor, and picking up items. Data collection encompasses 1,122 samples across nine positions with 1.5m separation.

**Doppler Spectrogram Comparative Analysis**: Systematic comparison reveals distinct Doppler signature characteristics:
- **CSI Spectrograms**: Uniform pulse patterns across frequency spectrum with high-frequency torso movements and low-frequency limb components
- **PWR Spectrograms**: Sinusoidal-wave patterns providing velocity and directional information through 1-second integration times

**Activity-Specific Performance Evaluation**: Individual activity analysis demonstrates system-specific advantages:
- **Walking Activity**: Both systems achieve >90% accuracy due to high Doppler shifts
- **Standing Activities**: CSI systems struggle with accuracy <50% for standing-related activities
- **Directional Activities**: PWR systems excel in detecting upward/downward movements with positive/negative Doppler signatures

**Layout-Dependent Performance Analysis**: Systematic evaluation across geometric configurations reveals:
- **CSI System Performance**: 90% accuracy in LoS (Layout 1), 70% bistatic (Layout 2), 62% monostatic (Layout 3)
- **PWR System Performance**: 60% accuracy in LoS (Layout 1), 70% bistatic (Layout 2), 91.3% monostatic (Layout 3)
- **Overall Combined Accuracy**: 67.3% CSI vs 66.7% PWR across all layouts

### System Integration and Coverage Analysis

**Complementary System Characteristics**: The analysis reveals that CSI and PWR systems exhibit complementary strengths rather than competitive performance. CSI systems provide superior performance in line-of-sight scenarios with fine-grained subcarrier analysis, while PWR systems excel in non-line-of-sight bistatic/monostatic configurations with directional movement detection capabilities.

**Coverage Area and Geometric Limitations**: Both systems demonstrate sensitivity to transmitter-target-receiver geometries, presenting coverage challenges for real-world deployment. The geometric dependency represents fundamental limitation requiring spatial diversity or multi-sensor approaches for comprehensive sensing coverage.

**Real-time Processing Capabilities**: PWR systems demonstrate real-time processing advantages through low-complexity CAF implementation, while CSI systems require offline processing for dimensionality reduction and spectrogram generation, limiting immediate response applications.
