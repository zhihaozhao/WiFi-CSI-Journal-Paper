## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system integrates privacy-preserving federated learning with WiFi Channel State Information processing through sophisticated cryptographic and machine learning frameworks:

**Federated CSI Aggregation Model**:
```
G_global^(t+1) = Σ(i=1 to N) (n_i/n) × G_i^(t+1)
```
Where G_i represents local gradient updates from client i, n_i is local data size, and n is total federation size.

**Privacy-Preserving CSI Transformation**:
```
X_private = ℰ(X_raw, k_enc) + δ_noise
δ_noise ~ Laplace(0, Δf/ε)
```
With differential privacy parameter ε controlling privacy-utility trade-off and sensitivity Δf.

**Secure Multi-Party Computation Protocol**:
```
Share_i = (Secret × r_i) mod p
Reconstruction = Σ(i=1 to k) (Share_i × λ_i) mod p
```
Using Shamir's secret sharing with threshold k and prime modulus p.

### Algorithmic Contributions

**1. Adaptive Differential Privacy Algorithm**: Dynamic privacy budget allocation based on model convergence:
- Privacy budget allocation: ε_total = Σ(t=1 to T) ε_t with adaptive scheduling
- Gradient clipping with L2-norm bounds: ||g_i||_2 ≤ C_clip
- Gaussian noise injection: g_noisy = g_clipped + N(0, σ²I)

**2. Federated Attention Mechanism**: Privacy-aware attention weights without exposing raw CSI:
```
Attention_federated = softmax(Σ_i w_i × A_i^encrypted)
```
Where A_i represents encrypted local attention matrices aggregated through homomorphic encryption.

**3. Secure Gradient Aggregation Protocol**: Byzantine-robust aggregation with cryptographic security:
- Gradient verification through zero-knowledge proofs
- Multi-level aggregation hierarchy reducing communication overhead
- Malicious client detection using statistical anomaly detection
