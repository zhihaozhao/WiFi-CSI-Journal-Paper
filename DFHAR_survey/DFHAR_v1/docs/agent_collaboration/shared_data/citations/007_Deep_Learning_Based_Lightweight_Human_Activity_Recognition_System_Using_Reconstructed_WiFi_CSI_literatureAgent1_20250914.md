## üî¨ Mathematical Framework Analysis

### CSI Signal Modeling
The paper establishes rigorous mathematical foundation for CSI analysis:

**Channel State Information Model**:
```
Y(f,t) = H(f,t) √ó X(f,t) + n(f,t)
Hi = Ii + jKi = |Hi|exp(j‚à†Hi)
```

**Multipath Component Analysis**:
```
Hi = Œ£(q=1 to N) Rq ¬∑ e^(-j2œÄfœÑq) ¬∑ e^(-j2œÄŒîft)
```

The mathematical framework effectively captures the relationship between human movement and CSI variations through path length changes: dq(t) = dq(0) ¬± vqt.

### Tensor Decomposition Theory
**Canonical Polyadic (CP) Decomposition**:
```
Œ∑ ‚âà Œ£(r=1 to 2R) xr ‚ó¶ yr ‚ó¶ zr
```

**Uniqueness Theorem Application**: The paper proves CP decomposition uniqueness using Theorem 4.1: pX + pY + pZ ‚â• 2R + 2, with pX ‚â• 3, pY = 2R, pZ = 2R, ensuring unique decomposition of the constructed CSI tensor.

### Optimization Framework
**Alternating Least Squares Algorithm**:
```
X = Œ∑(1)[(Z ‚äô Y)^T]‚Ä†
Y = Œ∑(2)(Z ‚äô X)(Z^T Z * X^T X)‚Ä†
Z = Œ∑(3)(Y ‚äô X)(Y^T Y * X^T X)‚Ä†
```
