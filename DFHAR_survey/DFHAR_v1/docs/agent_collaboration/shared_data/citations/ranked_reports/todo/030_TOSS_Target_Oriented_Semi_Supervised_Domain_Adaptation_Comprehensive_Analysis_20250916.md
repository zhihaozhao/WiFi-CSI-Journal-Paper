## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Algorithmic Contributions

#### 1. Target-Oriented Semi-Supervised (TOSS) Framework
The TOSS framework introduces revolutionary architectural innovations:

**Meta-Learning Foundation**:
- **Bi-Level Optimization**: Inner-outer loop structure with source and target task alternation
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  Inner loop: θ_tmp ← θ_i - α∇θ_i L_Ti(S_i, f_θi, Y_Si)
  Outer loop: θ_i+1 ← θ_i - β∇θ_i L_Ti(Q_i, f_θtmp, P(Q_i))
  ```
- **Hybrid Task Sampling**: Strategic mixing of homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks from multiple domains

**Semi-Supervised Integration**:
- **First SSDA Application**: Pioneering semi-supervised domain adaptation for WiFi-based HAR
- **Comprehensive Target Utilization**: Joint exploitation of labeled and unlabeled target samples
- **Target-Oriented Optimization**: Moving beyond source-biased approaches to target-focused adaptation

#### 2. Dynamic Pseudo Label Strategy
**Entropy-Based Balance Mechanism**:
- **Mathematical Innovation**: `BF = λ * e^(-Entropy)` (Equation 8)
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Automatic balance between soft and hard pseudo labels based on prediction uncertainty
- **Information Theory Foundation**: Entropy minimization in outer loop optimization for improved adaptation

**Soft/Hard Label Integration**:
- **Soft Labels**: Probability distributions from model predictions
- **Hard Labels**: Argmax-based discrete label assignments
- **Dynamic Balance**: Uncertainty-driven weighting preventing overfitting to incorrect pseudo labels

**Loss Function Design**:
```
Loss = KL_loss(f_θ(x^t), o^t) + BF * CE(f_θ(x^t), h^t) + γ * Entropy_mini
```

#### 3. Uncertainty-Based Inner Set Division
**Representative Sample Selection**:
- **Entropy Difference**: `Entropy_diff = Entropy_pre - Entropy_pro` (Equation 16)
- **Theoretical Justification**: Gradient analysis of MAML optimization showing sample representativeness
- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  ```
  E(g_MAML) ≈ E(∇L₁(θᵢ)) - E(∂L₁(θᵢ)∇L₀(θᵢ)/∂θ_tmp)
  ```

**Adversarial Training Mechanism**:
- **Overfitting Prevention**: Systematic prevention of single-task overfitting
- **Gradient Analysis**: Mathematical proof of sample selection effectiveness
- **Representative Quality**: Ensures selected samples maximize meta-learning effectiveness
