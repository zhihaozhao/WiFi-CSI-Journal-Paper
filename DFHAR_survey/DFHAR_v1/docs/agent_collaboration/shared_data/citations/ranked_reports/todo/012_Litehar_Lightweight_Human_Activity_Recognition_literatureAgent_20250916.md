### 1.2 Algorithmic Contribution Assessment

**Random Convolution Kernel Configuration**:
```
Kernel Parameters (from paper):
• Length: Randomly selected from {7, 9, 11} with equal probability
• Weights: Randomly sampled from Normal distribution N(0, 1)
• Bias: Randomly sampled from uniform distribution U(-1, 1)
• Dilation: Exponential scale sampling b^(2^a), where a ~ U(0, log₂((l_input-1)/(l_kernel-1)))
• Padding: Applied randomly with equal probability
• Stride: Set to one for all kernels
```

**Feature Extraction Innovation**:
- Each kernel φₐ produces two-value feature representation: (ppv, max)
- **ppv**: Proportion of positive values in convolution output
- **max**: Maximum value in convolution output
- Fixed-length feature vector generation from variable-length time series
- Total features per subcarrier: 2D (D = 10,000 kernels → 20,000 features)

**Mathematical Formulation**:
The voting mechanism for final prediction:
```
ỹ = argmax_c {∑ᴹₘ₌₁ 1[ỹₘ,1], ..., ∑ᴹₘ₌₁ 1[ỹₘ,C]}
```
where 1[ỹₘ,c] is indicator function and C is number of activity classes.
