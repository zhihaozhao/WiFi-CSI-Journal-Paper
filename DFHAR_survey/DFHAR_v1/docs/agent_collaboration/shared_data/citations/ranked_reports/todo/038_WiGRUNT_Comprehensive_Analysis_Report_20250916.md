## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Algorithmic Contributions

#### 1. Dual-Attention CSI Network (DACN)
The DACN architecture introduces two complementary attention mechanisms:

**Temporal-Spatial Attention Module A**:
- Focuses on "where to look" in CSI images
- Mathematical formulation: `Atsa(ImP) = σ(f^(7×7)(BN(ImP)))`
- Uses 7×7 convolution for pixel-level attention weight assignment

**Temporal-Spatial Attention Module B**:
- Focuses on "when to look" in feature maps
- Mathematical formulation: `Atsb(ImP'') = σ(MLP(AvgPool(ImP'')) + MLP(MaxPool(ImP'')))`
- Combines average and max pooling for channel importance evaluation

#### 2. CSI-Ratio Denoising Method
- **Innovation**: Eliminates random phase offset through ratio computation
- **Mathematical Foundation**: `Hq(f,t) = H1(f,t)/H2(f,t)`
- **Technical Advantage**: Preserves gesture-induced variations while removing system noise

#### 3. CSI Visualization Transformation
- Converts 4D CSI tensor (N×M×K×T) to time-series images
- Enables computer vision techniques for WiFi signal processing
- Eliminates need for handcrafted feature extraction
