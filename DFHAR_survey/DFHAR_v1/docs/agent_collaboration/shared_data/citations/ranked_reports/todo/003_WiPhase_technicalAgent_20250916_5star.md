## Algorithmic Innovation Analysis

### 1. Core Algorithmic Contributions

#### **1.1 CSI Phase Integration Representation (CSI-PIR)**
**Innovation Type**: Major Feature Engineering Breakthrough - Novel phase reconstruction methodology

**Key Mathematical Framework**:
```
Phase Difference: Δ∠c^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_{s,m} = Δ∠c^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_{s,t} + ΔP_{dff} + ΔE
Phase Ratio: pr^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_s = e^{-j∠c^{n_t,n_r+1}_{s,t}}/e^{-j∠c^{n_t,n_r}_{s,t}}
CSI-PIR: c^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_{s,pir} = pr^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_s · e^{-jΔ∠c^{n_t,n_r,n_r+1}_{s,m}}
```

**Technical Breakthrough**: Successfully eliminates time-varying random phase offsets that plague traditional CSI processing by constructing phase ratios between adjacent receiving antennas. This addresses the fundamental CSI phase noise problem.

**Novelty Assessment**: **9/10** - First systematic approach to CSI phase reconstruction that preserves activity-related information while removing system artifacts.

#### **1.2 Gated Pseudo-Siamese Network (GPSiam)**
**Innovation Type**: Architecture Innovation - Novel two-stream temporal feature extraction

**Key Components**:
- **Residual Causal Convolutional Networks (ResCCNs)**: Right-aligned temporal processing
- **Gated Attention Module**: Combines max pooling, average pooling with tanh/sigmoid gating
- **Pseudo-Siamese Structure**: Different weights for phase difference and phase ratio streams

**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
Training Objective:
L = L_{pd} + L_{pr} + L_s
L_{pd} = -ω_{pd} Σ_a y^a_{pd} log(f_{pd}(h^{pd}_a; θ_{pd}))
L_{pr} = -ω_{pr} Σ_a y^a_{pr} log(f_{pr}(h^{pr}_a; θ_{pr}))
L_s = -ω_s Σ_a y^a_s log(f_s(op^{pd}_a, op^{pr}_a; θ_{pd}, θ_{pr}))
```

**Technical Merit**: O(T) complexity vs O(T²) for Transformers and O(Th + h²) for LSTM, where T is sequence length.

#### **1.3 Dynamic Resolution Graph Attention Network (DRGAT)**
**Innovation Type**: Graph Learning Breakthrough - Sub-carrier correlation extraction

**Multi-Resolution Architecture**:
```
G^{R1,Rs} ∈ ℝ^{R1×Rs}, G^{R2,Rs} ∈ ℝ^{R2×Rs}, G^{R3,Rs} ∈ ℝ^{R3×Rs}
500 ≤ R1 ≤ R2 ≤ R3 ≤ 1000, Rs = 30
```

**Graph Attention Mechanism**:
```
g'_r = ||^Q_{q=1} σ(Σ_{γ∈N_r} α^q_{rγ}W^q g_γ)
α_{rγ} = softmax(e_{rγ}) = exp(e_{rγ})/Σ_{μ∈N_r} exp(e_{rμ})
e_{rγ} = LeakyReLU(W_f(W g_r || W g_γ))
```

**Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) Edge Construction**:
```
min Σ^L_{l=1} ||D_i(a_l) - D_j(b_l)||
s.t. (a_1, b_1) = (0, 0), (a_L, b_L) = (M-1, M-1)
     a_l ≤ a_{l+1} ≤ a_l + 1, b_l ≤ b_{l+1} ≤ b_l + 1
```
