## 1. Technical Innovation Analysis

### 1.1 Core Innovation Framework

**Primary Innovation**: Quantitative gesture parameter estimation using CSI phase relationships
- **Novelty**: First system to achieve fine-grained distance measurement (few centimeters) using COTS WiFi devices
- **Technical Breakthrough**: Phase-based distance quantification with accuracy comparable to specialized radar systems
- **Algorithmic Advancement**: Real-time dynamic component separation in multipath environments

### 1.2 Key Technological Contributions

#### Phase-Distance Relationship Model
```
Mathematical Foundation:
d = -ΔφBλ/(2aπ)

Where:
- d: movement distance
- Δφ: phase change of dynamic component
- λ: radio wavelength (6 cm at 5 GHz)
- a: path length change ratio (typically a=2)
```

**Innovation Significance**: Direct mathematical relationship between CSI phase changes and physical movement distance, enabling quantitative gesture measurement.

#### Advanced Phase Correction Algorithm
**Technical Problem**: CFO (Carrier Frequency Offset) and SFO (Sampling Frequency Offset) introduce phase noise orders of magnitude larger than gesture-induced changes.

**Algorithmic Solution**:
1. **CFO Removal**: Utilize subcarrier with largest static component magnitude as reference
2. **SFO/PBD Correction**: Linear regression across 30 OFDM subcarriers per antenna pair
3. **Phase Preservation**: Careful selection ensures hand movement phases remain intact

**Quantitative Impact**: Reduces phase noise from >50π to <0.1 radian, enabling reliable gesture detection.

## 2. Algorithm Architecture Analysis

### 2.1 LEVD (Local Extreme Value Detection) Algorithm

**Innovation**: Dynamic static component tracking in complex multipath environments

#### Algorithm Design Principles:
```

```

**Algorithmic Breakthrough**: Adapts to slowly changing static components caused by body movements while preserving gesture-induced phase variations.

**Quantitative Results**: 15° average absolute direction error, 3.7 cm distance accuracy in 2D scenarios.

### 2.3 Signal Processing Pipeline

#### Phase Correction Workflow:
1. **CFO Estimation**: Select antenna pair with largest static component
2. **Reference Selection**: Interpolate subcarrier 0 from adjacent subcarriers (-1, +1)
3. **Phase Alignment**: Subtract CFO from all antenna pairs
4. **SFO Correction**: Linear regression per frame for slope estimation
5. **Magnitude Smoothing**: 80-sample moving average filter (oversampling at 2500 Hz)

**Technical Validation**: Raw phase variations of π reduced to consistent <0.1 radian after correction.
