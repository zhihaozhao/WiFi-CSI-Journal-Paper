## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Algorithmic Contributions

#### 1. Anti-Interference System Architecture (WiAnti)
The WiAnti system introduces a comprehensive three-stage approach to interference handling:

**Stage 1: CCI Detection**:
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Packet-based detection using `|Pm - Pm-1|/Pm-1 < σ`
- **Innovation**: Real-time interference identification with empirical thresholds (σ = 0.1)
- **Technical Merit**: Distinguishes between constant and varying CCI scenarios

**Stage 2: CCI Classification**:
- **Variability Assessment**: `|Pm - P̄|/P̄ < ξ` for CCI type determination (ξ = 0.07)
- **Adaptive Strategy**: Dynamic algorithm selection based on interference characteristics
- **Performance Optimization**: Context-aware processing for different CCI patterns

**Stage 3: Adaptive Subcarrier Selection**:
- **Dual Algorithm Framework**: Pearson-based and DTW-based correlation analysis
- **Information Theory Foundation**: Weakly correlated subcarriers maximize information content
- **Mathematical Justification**: Joint entropy E(q,w) = E(q) + E(w) - ψ(q;w)

#### 2. Pearson-Based Subcarrier Selection Algorithm
**Mathematical Formulation**:
```
r_q,w = Σ(qi - q̄)(wi - w̄) / √[Σ(qi - q̄)² Σ(wi - w̄)²]
```

**Technical Innovation**:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson coefficient for sequence similarity measurement

- **Flexibility**: Adapts to varying CCI scenarios with temporal variations
- **Performance Achievement**: 94.125% average RAR in varying CCI scenarios

### Mathematical Framework Excellence

#### CSI Channel Modeling
**Physical Foundation**:
```
yi = Hixi + ni
hi(k)(ω,t) = e^(-j·2πΔωt) Σ ϕγ(ω,t) · e^(-j·2πωτγ(t))
```

**Innovation**: Clear mathematical connection between path length changes and phase shifts, providing theoretical basis for activity recognition through CSI analysis.
