The system introduces a semi-supervised cross-modal learning framework that leverages synchronized visual information to automatically generate labels for WiFi CSI data, eliminating the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual annotation process. Through the integration of a lightweight multi-view WiFi sensing model (MvNet) and a hybrid loss function combining cross-entropy and feature distillation losses, AutoDLAR achieves over 95.89% accuracy with only 3.35ms inference time, establishing a new paradigm for practical DFHAR deployment.

## Technical Innovation and Contribution

### Core Innovation Framework

The fundamental breakthrough lies in the development of a semi-supervised cross-modal transfer learning architecture that bridges the semantic gap between visual and WiFi signal domains. Unlike traditional supervised approaches that require extensive manual labeling or existing cross-modal methods that rely on expensive specialized hardware, AutoDLAR utilizes commodity WiFi devices paired with a standard camera to create an automatic labeling pipeline.

### Mathematical Framework and Architecture

**1. Cross-Modal Transfer Formulation**
The system optimizes the objective function:
```
min L(Ω(V), Φ(W))
(V,W)
```
where Ω(·) represents the video-based guidance network and Φ(·) denotes the WiFi-based sensing model, with the goal of minimizing prediction bias between modalities.

**2. Hybrid Loss Function Design**
The training employs a sophisticated hybrid loss mechanism:
```
Ltotal(ξ) = αLCE + (1 − α)LMSE
```
where:
- LCE represents the softmax-based classification loss using temperature-scaled softmax for softer probability distributions
- LMSE denotes the FC-based distillation loss for feature-level knowledge transfer
- α = 0.6 provides optimal balance between classification and distillation objectives

**3. Multi-View WiFi Sensing Model (MvNet)**
The lightweight MvNet architecture incorporates three specialized branches:
- **Channel of View (CoV)**: Standard convolution layers with 1×3 kernels for channel-wise feature extraction
- **Subcarrier of View (SoV)**: Dilated convolution layers with dilation rate 3 for subcarrier relationship modeling
- **Time of View (ToV)**: Temporal CNN with 3×1 kernels for temporal pattern recognition
- **Feature fusion**: 1×1 convolution layer for nonlinear characteristic enhancement

### Methodological Strengths

**1. Automatic Data Labeling Pipeline**
The system achieves complete automation of the labeling process through a sophisticated video-based guidance model built on R(2+1)D-18 architecture pre-trained on the Kinetics dataset. The video model generates high-confidence pseudo-labels for WiFi data, eliminating human annotation requirements while maintaining labeling accuracy.

**2. Lightweight Architecture Design**
MvNet demonstrates remarkable efficiency with only 0.47M parameters and 105M FLOPs, significantly outperforming existing methods like ABLSTM (1.96M parameters) and THAT (3.15M parameters) while achieving superior recognition accuracy. This architectural efficiency enables real-time deployment on resource-constrained devices.

**3. Temperature-Scaled Knowledge Distillation**
The implementation of temperature-scaled softmax (Q=5) in the cross-modal transfer process enhances inter-class relationship learning, producing "softer" probability distributions that facilitate more effective knowledge transfer from the visual to WiFi domain.
