## Executive Summary

This paper presents DPSense, a groundbreaking sensing framework that addresses the fundamental challenge of heterogeneous sensing quality within WiFi-based gesture recognition systems. The work introduces a novel theoretical model linking gesture signals with ambient noise, from which the authors derive a unique Error of Dynamic Phase index (EDP-index) to quantify signal sensing quality. The framework achieves remarkable improvements in gesture recognition accuracy, with up to 94% average performance and significant enhancements over state-of-the-art methods across different locations and orientations. This represents a paradigm shift from treating all signal segments uniformly to quality-aware signal processing that maximizes high-quality segment contribution while minimizing low-quality segment impact.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Signal Quality Characterization Framework**: The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing and mathematically modeling the phenomenon of heterogeneous sensing quality within individual gestures. Unlike prior work that treats all signal segments uniformly, this research identifies that different segments of the same gesture exhibit vastly different sensing qualities based on location and orientation relative to WiFi transceivers. The authors establish that signal quality varies according to how hand motion intersects with Fresnel zones, creating segments where gesture signals dominate versus segments where ambient noise overwhelms the gesture signal.

**Mathematical Foundation for Quality Assessment**: The paper develops a rigorous mathematical model decomposing the received CSI signal into static components, gesture signals, and ambient noise. The model establishes that ambient noise follows a zero-mean, isotropic bi-variate normal distribution, providing theoretical foundations for quality quantification. This mathematical rigor enables the derivation of the sensing quality metric Œ∑(t) = (ŒîŒ∏(t) - ŒîœÜ(t))/ŒîœÜ(t), capturing the relationship between measured phase variations and true gesture-induced phase variations.

**Error of Dynamic Phase Index (EDP-index)**: The core algorithmic innovation is the EDP-index metric, derived from statistical analysis of phase variation distributions. The metric is calculated as EDP = (n-1)(ŒîŒ∏)¬≤/Œ£(ŒîŒ∏·µ¢ - ŒîŒ∏)¬≤, providing a quantitative measure of sensing quality that enables automatic classification of signal segments into 'valid' and 'invalid' categories for differential processing.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Quality-Oriented Signal Processing Pipeline**: The DPSense framework implements a sophisticated three-stage processing pipeline: (1) EDP-index calculation and signal quality classification, (2) adaptive processing for valid signals through multi-carrier alignment and ambient noise alleviation, and (3) motion speculation for invalid signals using learned patterns. This architecture enables robust gesture recognition across diverse environmental conditions and user positions.

**Multi-Carrier Signal Enhancement**: For valid signals, the system implements innovative multi-carrier alignment techniques that amplify gesture signal components while minimizing ambient noise impact. The approach leverages frequency-selective fading properties where ambient noise components across different subcarriers are independent, enabling constructive combination of gesture signals while random superposition reduces noise impact.

**Cross-Domain Adaptability**: The framework demonstrates exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities, maintaining consistent performance across different locations and orientations. The quality-aware processing inherently adapts to environmental variations by dynamically adjusting the contribution of different signal segments based on their sensing quality rather than applying uniform processing.

## Mathematical Framework Analysis

### Signal Modeling and Theoretical Foundation

**Comprehensive CSI Decomposition**: The paper establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation with the CSI model:
```
H(f,t) = Hs(f) + A(f,t)e^(-j2œÄl(t)/Œª) + E(f,t)
```
where the static component Hs(f) represents environmental reflections, A(f,t)e^(-j2œÄl(t)/Œª) represents gesture signals, and E(f,t) represents ambient noise including both channel-induced Gaussian noise and dynamic multipath signals from other moving objects.

**Statistical Analysis of Sensing Quality**: The authors provide comprehensive statistical analysis demonstrating that the variance of sensing quality Œ∑(t) can be estimated as D(Œ∑(t)) = D(ŒîŒ∏(t))/[E(ŒîŒ∏(t))]¬≤. This relationship enables practical quality estimation using only measured phase variations, making the approach implementable on commodity WiFi devices without requiring separation of gesture signals from noise.

**Convergence and Theoretical Guarantees**: The mathematical framework provides theoretical guarantees for the EDP-index calculation, establishing that higher EDP values correspond to better sensing quality. The paper includes rigorous derivation showing that E(ŒîŒ∏(t)) = ŒîœÜ(t), enabling practical estimation of sensing quality variance using measurable quantities.

## Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### Comprehensive Multi-Scenario Evaluation

**Cross-Location Performance Excellence**: Extensive experimental validation demonstrates remarkable robustness across five different locations with accuracy improvements of 70% over WiFinger, 9.7% over FingerDraw, and 7.2% over WiGesture. The system maintains 94%+ average accuracy across all tested scenarios, with particular strength in challenging cross-domain settings where traditional methods experience significant degradation.

**Orientation-Independent Recognition**: The framework shows exceptional stability across different gesture orientations, with improvements of 17.8% over FingerDraw and 12.2% over WiFinger when comparing worst-case scenarios across orientations. This represents a fundamental advance in addressing the orientation dependency problem that has limited practical deployment of WiFi gesture recognition systems.

**Multi-Gesture Set Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation across three distinct gesture sets (basic gestures: 97.2%, digits: 96.8%, mathematical symbols: 94.7%) demonstrates the generality of the approach. The framework maintains high performance across gesture complexity levels, from simple directional movements to complex multi-stroke patterns requiring sophisticated motion tracking.

### Environmental Robustness and Real-World Performance

**Multi-Environment Stability**: Testing across diverse indoor environments (office rooms, living rooms, meeting rooms) with varying multipath characteristics shows minimal performance degradation. The quality-aware processing inherently adapts to environmental noise levels and multipath conditions, maintaining consistent recognition accuracy regardless of deployment location.

**User Diversity and Practical Deployment**: Evaluation with 12 users of varying demographics (ages 19-40, 4 females, 8 males) demonstrates user-independent performance with 96.4% average accuracy. The framework successfully handles variations in hand size, gesture execution style, and movement patterns that typically challenge WiFi sensing systems.

**Interference Resilience**: Systematic evaluation of interference scenarios including human movement, spinning fans, and concurrent activities shows graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. The EDP-index effectively identifies periods of strong interference and adapts processing accordingly, maintaining functionality in realistic deployment scenarios.

## Cross-Domain Generalization and Theoretical Significance

### Domain Adaptation Mechanisms

**Location-Independent Feature Extraction**: The quality-aware processing inherently creates location-independent features by emphasizing signal segments with high sensing quality regardless of absolute position. This approach moves beyond traditional feature engineering to adaptive feature selection based on signal characteristics, achieving superior cross-domain performance.

**Orientation-Adaptive Recognition**: The framework's ability to handle varying gesture orientations stems from the fundamental insight that orientation affects sensing quality in predictable ways. By quantifying these effects through the EDP-index, the system can maintain recognition accuracy even when gesture segments have vastly different sensing characteristics.

**Theoretical Foundation for Generalization**: The mathematical model provides theoretical explanation for why quality-aware processing achieves superior generalization. By focusing on signal segments where gesture signals dominate ambient noise, the approach naturally selects features that are more likely to be consistent across different deployment conditions.

## Practical Implementation and Deployment Considerations

### Real-World System Design

**Commodity Hardware Compatibility**: The framework is designed for implementation on commodity WiFi devices using standard Intel 5300 NICs and open-source CSI extraction tools. The computational requirements are modest, with processing times of 0.4 seconds for 1 second of CSI data at 400Hz sampling rate, enabling real-time operation on standard laptop hardware.

**Multi-Transceiver Configuration**: The system employs a practical two-pair transceiver setup that provides sufficient spatial diversity for quality assessment while maintaining reasonable deployment complexity. The configuration balances sensing coverage with implementation practicality, making the approach suitable for consumer applications.

**Adaptive Parameter Selection**: The framework includes adaptive mechanisms for threshold selection and quality classification that adjust to local environmental conditions. This adaptability reduces deployment complexity and improves robustness across diverse real-world conditions.

## Critical Assessment and Limitations

While this limitation is acknowledged, it represents a significant constraint for applications requiring concurrent multi-user interaction.

**Environmental Noise Sensitivity**: Although the framework shows remarkable robustness to typical ambient noise, extreme electromagnetic interference or very weak gesture signals can still overwhelm the quality-aware processing. The approach works best in environments where gesture signals achieve at least minimal signal-to-noise ratios.

**Computational Overhead**: The quality assessment and adaptive processing introduce computational overhead compared to simple signal processing approaches. While the authors demonstrate real-time capability, the additional processing may limit deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### Methodological Considerations

## Executive Summary

This groundbreaking research addresses two fundamental challenges that have limited the practical deployment of WiFi-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems: imbalanced training datasets and changing environmental circumstances. The authors introduce Class Region Flattening (CRF), a novel methodology that seeks class-conditional flat minima to enhance generalization capabilities across diverse deployment scenarios. The work demonstrates that existing WiFi-based HAR models often converge to sharp minima when trained on long-tailed distributions, significantly reducing their cross-domain performance. Through comprehensive experimental validation on six distinct indoor environments with varying imbalance ratios, the proposed CRF and CRF-S (selective flattening) methods achieve substantial improvements, with up to 9.25% accuracy gains for TOSS, 1.65% for DANN, and 1.24% for CNN models.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Unified Approach to Dual Challenges**: The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing that both imbalanced data distribution and domain adaptation challenges can be addressed through a unified geometric optimization perspective. Rather than treating these as separate problems, the authors establish that both issues manifest as sharp minima in the parameter space, leading to poor generalization across activity categories and environmental conditions. This insight enables a single mathematical framework to simultaneously address data imbalance and domain shift.

**Class Region Flattening (CRF) Framework**: The core algorithmic contribution introduces category-specific parameter perturbation mechanisms that seek flat minima for each activity class independently. Unlike traditional approaches that apply uniform optimization strategies, CRF recognizes that different activity classes exhibit varying loss landscapes, particularly in imbalanced scenarios where tail classes suffer from insufficient training samples. The method implements class-conditional perturbations using the mathematical formulation:

```
L_flat(w_tmp) = Œ£(c=1 to k) L^c_flat(w_tmp)
L^c_flat(w_tmp) = max(||Œµ_c||_2‚â§œÅ_c) L^c_erm(w_tmp + Œµ_c) ‚âà L^c_erm(w^c_tmp)
Œµ*_c = Œ∑ * œÅ_c * (‚àá_w_tmp L^c_erm(w_tmp))/(||‚àá_w_tmp L^c_erm(w_tmp)||_2)
```

**Selective Flattening Strategy (CRF-S)**: To address computational overhead and gradient conflicts inherent in class-based optimization, the authors introduce CRF-S, which employs similarity-based gradient selection. This innovation calculates cosine similarity between class-specific gradients and the average gradient, selecting the most aligned gradients for perturbation. This approach reduces optimization conflicts while maintaining computational efficiency, achieving superior performance improvements of approximately 2% across all baseline models.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Theoretical Foundation Integration**: The framework leverages Perturbative PAC-Bayesian Generalization Theory to provide mathematical rigor for the flat minima search process. The authors extend beyond empirical observations to establish theoretical guarantees for generalization improvement, deriving that the perturbation direction aligning with the first-order derivative maximizes the generalization bound. This theoretical grounding distinguishes CRF from purely empirical approaches.

**Multi-Model Compatibility**: The system design ensures seamless integration with existing WiFi-based HAR architectures, including CNN, DANN, and TOSS models. The perturbation mechanism operates as a training augmentation rather than architectural modification, enabling broad applicability across different neural network designs. The framework maintains compatibility with various baseline training methodologies while providing consistent performance improvements.

**Adaptive Parameter Management**: The system implements sophisticated hyperparameter adaptation mechanisms, including dynamic perturbation radius selection (œÅ) and gradient selection thresholds (Œ∫_t). The experimental analysis reveals optimal parameter ranges: œÅ = 3.0 √ó 10^-6, Œ± = 0.4, and Œ∫_t = 2 for four-class scenarios, with adaptive mechanisms for different problem scales.

## Mathematical Framework Analysis

### Loss Landscape Geometric Analysis

**Sharp vs. Flat Minima Characterization**: The authors provide comprehensive 1D and 2D loss landscape visualizations demonstrating that conventional WiFi-based HAR models converge to sharp minima, particularly for tail classes in imbalanced scenarios. The mathematical analysis reveals that sharp minima correspond to poor generalization, with loss values increasing rapidly under parameter perturbations. The empirical analysis shows that TOSS and MetaSense exhibit sharper curves compared to CNN baselines, motivating the flattening approach.

**Class-Conditional Optimization Theory**: The mathematical framework extends Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) principles to class-conditional scenarios through the formulation:

```
L_overall = L_erm(w_tmp) + Œ± * L_flat(w_tmp)
```

where the flattening loss L_flat aggregates class-specific perturbations. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach enables discovery of minima that are simultaneously flat across all activity categories, addressing the fundamental challenge of imbalanced learning in WiFi sensing scenarios.

**First-Order Taylor Approximation Validation**: The authors provide rigorous mathematical analysis validating the use of first-order Taylor expansion for perturbation calculation. The error analysis demonstrates that second-order terms contribute negligibly (|R_2| ‚â§ 5 √ó 10^-15) given the perturbation magnitudes, justifying the computational efficiency of first-order approximations while maintaining optimization accuracy.

### Convergence and Optimization Guarantees

**Gradient Conflict Resolution**: The mathematical framework addresses gradient conflicts through similarity-based selection mechanisms. The analysis reveals that randomly selecting class-specific gradients can lead to divergent optimization directions, particularly when gradients exhibit significant angular deviations. The CRF-S approach mitigates this through:

```
Sim(g^c, ·∏°) = (g^c * ·∏°)/(||g^c * ·∏°||)
·∏° = (1/k)Œ£(c=1 to k)g^c, g^c = ‚àá_w_tmp L^c(w_tmp)
```

**Computational Complexity Analysis**: The framework provides detailed computational complexity analysis, demonstrating that CRF requires multiple forward and backward propagations per class, while CRF-S reduces this overhead through selective updates. The time complexity analysis shows average reductions of 1.24% for CNN, 1.9% for DANN, and 2.12% for TOSS models while achieving superior performance improvements.

## Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### Comprehensive Multi-Environment Evaluation

**Cross-Domain Robustness Assessment**: The experimental validation encompasses 13 sets of 1-on-1 domain adaptation experiments across six diverse indoor environments (building entrance, corridor, hall, laboratory, meeting room, open platform). The results demonstrate consistent improvements across varying environmental conditions, with CRF-S achieving average accuracy increases of 3.5% for CNN, 3.55% for DANN, and 11.37% for TOSS models compared to baseline methods.

**Imbalance Ratio Scalability**: The framework demonstrates robust performance across varying imbalance ratios (10, 50, 100), with consistent improvements maintained even under extreme imbalance conditions. The experimental analysis reveals that TOSS models benefit most significantly from the flattening approach (15% improvement at ratio 100), while CNN and DANN models show more modest but consistent gains (5-6% improvement).

**Multi-Source and Multi-Target Validation**: The comprehensive evaluation includes multi-source domain adaptation (environments E3-E6 to E1) and multi-target scenarios (E1 to E3-E6), demonstrating generalizability beyond simple pairwise domain transfer. The results show improvements of 4.34% for DANN in multi-source scenarios and 3.74% for TOSS in multi-target configurations.

### Statistical Analysis and Visualization

**Loss Landscape Visualization**: The 2D loss landscape analysis provides compelling visual evidence of the flattening effect, particularly for tail classes. The visualizations demonstrate that conventional methods result in steep loss surfaces for underrepresented activities, while CRF-S produces more uniform flat regions across all categories. This visual evidence supports the theoretical framework and explains the improved generalization performance.

**Ablation Study Insights**: The comprehensive ablation studies reveal that perturbation direction contributes more significantly than perturbation magnitude to performance improvements. The analysis demonstrates that both CRF and CRF-S benefit from each component, with selective flattening providing the most substantial contribution to optimization stability and performance enhancement.

## Cross-Domain Generalization and Theoretical Significance

### Fundamental Insights into WiFi Sensing Challenges

**Imbalanced Learning in Wireless Sensing**: This work provides the first comprehensive treatment of imbalanced learning specifically within WiFi-based HAR contexts. The authors demonstrate that conventional domain adaptation methods fail to address the unique challenges posed by long-tailed activity distributions, where critical activities (such as falling) constitute small portions of training data due to practical collection constraints.

**Environmental Adaptation Mechanisms**: The framework establishes fundamental principles for environmental adaptation in wireless sensing, demonstrating that flat minima correspond to robust signal processing strategies that generalize across different multipath environments, interference conditions, and deployment scenarios.

The system provides guidance for threshold selection and quality classification parameters that enable deployment across diverse real-world scenarios.

## Critical Assessment and Limitations

### Technical Constraints and Challenges

**Computational Overhead Considerations**: While CRF-S reduces computational overhead compared to CRF, the method still requires dual gradient computations for parameter perturbation and updates. The training time analysis reveals 15-20% increases in computational cost across different baseline models, which may limit deployment in resource-constrained environments.

**Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The framework requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters (œÅ, Œ±, Œ∫_t), with performance showing sensitivity to these parameters. While the authors provide empirical guidance for parameter selection, optimal values may require environment-specific tuning for peak performance.

**Limited Activity Complexity**: The evaluation focuses primarily on basic activities (walking, jumping, turning, sitting/standing) within controlled indoor environments. The generalizability to more complex activity patterns, outdoor scenarios, or highly dynamic environments requires additional validation.

### Methodological Considerations

**Gradient Selection Strategy Limitations**: The similarity-based gradient selection in CRF-S, while effective, relies on cosine similarity measures that may not capture all aspects of gradient compatibility. The authors acknowledge that adaptive selection strategies could further improve stability and performance.

**Environmental Diversity Constraints**: While the evaluation encompasses six diverse indoor environments, the framework's performance in scenarios with extreme electromagnetic interference, highly reflective surfaces, or non-stationary environmental conditions requires further investigation.
