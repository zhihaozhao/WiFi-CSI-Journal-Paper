The sliding window approach with continuous data capture represents significant advancement over traditional batch processing methods.

**Object Detection Paradigm Application (High)**: Novel application of computer vision object detection techniques (Mask R-CNN) to WiFi sensing domain, treating activity recognition as object detection and instance segmentation problem rather than traditional classification.

**Multi-domain Signal Analysis (Medium-High)**: The integration of continuous wavelet transform for simultaneous time-frequency analysis provides richer signal representation compared to traditional FFT-based approaches, enabling better activity discrimination in streaming scenarios.

## 🔬 Technical Framework Analysis

### System Architecture
The proposed system comprises three main components:

**1. CSI Collection Module**:
- Real-time signal capture using sliding window approach
- Intel NIC5300 for CSI data acquisition
- Sampling rate: 80 packets/second
- Window-based stream processing: S = <d₁, d₂, d₃, ...>

**2. CSI-to-Image Transformation**:
- Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) application
- Mathematical formulation: CWT(t,ω) = (ω/ωₒ)^(1/2) ∫s(t')Ψ*[ω/ωₒ(t'-t)]dt'
- Time-frequency domain image generation
- Frame distance measure to reduce redundancy

**3. Object Detection Network**:
- Mask R-CNN based architecture with ResNet-50 backbone

### Mathematical Formulation Analysis
**CSI Signal Model**:
```
y = Hx + n
H = [h₁, h₂, ..., h₃₀]  (30 subcarriers)
```

**Loss Function Optimization**:
```
L = Lcls + Lbbox + Lmask
L({pi}, {ti}) = (1/Ncls)ΣLcls(pi,gi) + λ(1/Nreg)ΣgiLreg(ti,ti*) + (1/m²)Σzi,jlog(ẑᵏi,j)
```

The mathematical framework effectively integrates computer vision loss formulation with WiFi signal processing, enabling end-to-end optimization.
