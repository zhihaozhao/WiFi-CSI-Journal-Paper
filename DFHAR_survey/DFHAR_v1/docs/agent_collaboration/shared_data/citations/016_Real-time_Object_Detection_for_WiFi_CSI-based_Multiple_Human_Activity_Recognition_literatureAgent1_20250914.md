- Window-based stream processing: S = <d‚ÇÅ, d‚ÇÇ, d‚ÇÉ, ...>

**2. CSI-to-Image Transformation**:
- Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) application
- Mathematical formulation: CWT(t,œâ) = (œâ/œâ‚Çí)^(1/2) ‚à´s(t')Œ®*[œâ/œâ‚Çí(t'-t)]dt'
- Time-frequency domain image generation
- Frame distance measure to reduce redundancy

**Loss Function Optimization**:
```
L = Lcls + Lbbox + Lmask
L({pi}, {ti}) = (1/Ncls)Œ£Lcls(pi,gi) + Œª(1/Nreg)Œ£giLreg(ti,ti*) + (1/m¬≤)Œ£zi,jlog(·∫ë·µèi,j)
