## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system integrates real-time edge computing with ultra-low latency WiFi sensing through advanced computational scheduling and resource optimization:

**Real-Time Scheduling Model**:
```
minimize: Σ_i w_i × max(0, C_i - D_i)
subject to: Σ_j U_j ≤ 1, ∀i: R_i + C_i ≤ D_i
```
Where w_i is task weight, C_i completion time, D_i deadline, and U_j utilization factor.

**Edge Computing Resource Allocation**:
```
Allocation_optimal = arg min Σ_k [P_k(f_k) × α + L_k(f_k) × β]
subject to: Σ_k f_k ≤ F_total, L_max ≤ L_target
```
Balancing power consumption P_k and latency L_k across computing frequencies f_k.

**Predictive Load Balancing Algorithm**:
```
Load_prediction(t+Δt) = ARIMA(Historical_load, Seasonal_patterns)
Task_migration = Hungarian_algorithm(Cost_matrix, Capacity_constraints)
```
Using time series prediction and optimal assignment for proactive load distribution.
