## Executive Summary

This paper addresses a critical limitation in WiFi-based vital signs monitoring by introducing the first identity-aware multi-person system capable of simultaneous monitoring of breathing and heartbeat for multiple individuals while maintaining robustness against dynamic interferences. The system achieves exceptional performance with 99.1% accuracy for breathing monitoring and 97.9% for heartbeat monitoring through innovative spatial domain separation and signal decoupling techniques.

## Technical Contribution Analysis

### Core Innovation
SpaceBeat represents a significant advancement in WiFi-based sensing by solving two fundamental challenges: (1) identity-aware vital signs monitoring that can determine which vital sign belongs to which person, and (2) interference-robust operation in multi-person environments with dynamic activities. The system leverages spatial domain separation using 2D angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation combined with a novel contrastive Principal Component Analysis-Contrastive Learning (cPCA-CL) framework.

### Methodological Framework
The system employs a comprehensive four-stage approach:
1. **Multi-person Separation and Localization**: Uses L-shaped antenna arrays to estimate 2D AoA (azimuth and elevation) with enhanced resolvability through multidimensional information integration (ToF, AoD)
2. **Signal Decoupling**: Novel cPCA-CL framework that designates target person signals as foreground and others as background, then iteratively separates coupled signals
3. **Vital Signs Extraction**: Breathing rate extraction through FFT and sophisticated heartbeat extraction using harmonic cancellation
4. **Identity-Aware Monitoring**: Spatial location-based assignment of vital signs to specific individuals

### Technical Depth Assessment
**Strengths:**
- First identity-aware multi-person WiFi vital signs monitoring system
- Novel combination of cPCA and contrastive learning for signal decoupling
- Comprehensive multidimensional signal processing (2D AoA, ToF, AoD)
- Sophisticated harmonic cancellation for heartbeat extraction
- Extensive experimental validation across multiple environments and conditions
- Achieves state-of-the-art performance with 99.1% breathing and 97.9% heartbeat accuracy

**Limitations:**
- Requires multiple antennas in L-shaped configuration limiting deployment scenarios
- Computational complexity of 4D MUSIC algorithm prevents real-time implementation
- Limited to three people maximum in current evaluation
- Requires target persons to remain relatively stationary during monitoring
- High computational cost due to exhaustive 4D parameter search

## Cross-Domain Generalization Insights

### Multi-Person Sensing Advancement
This work represents a breakthrough in multi-person sensing applications with several key innovations applicable to broader WiFi sensing domains:

### Spatial Domain Processing
The transition from signal domain to spatial domain processing offers significant advantages:
- **Identity-Aware Monitoring**: Unlike previous approaches that separate signals without identity awareness, SpaceBeat maintains person-specific tracking
- **Interference Robustness**: Spatial separation enables selective processing of target person signals while filtering interference
- **Scalability**: Framework supports expansion to larger numbers of people within antenna array resolution limits

### Signal Decoupling Innovation
The cPCA-CL framework introduces novel concepts applicable to various multi-target sensing scenarios:
- **Foreground-Background Separation**: Systematic approach to isolating target signals from interference
