## Technical Deep Dive

### Architectural Innovation and Design

**Temporal Convolutional Network Foundation**: The core innovation lies in adapting TCN architecture for WiFi CSI processing, replacing traditional sequence-to-sequence models with convolutional approaches. The TCN architecture provides three critical advantages:

1. **Causal Convolutions**: Maintains temporal causality by preventing future information leakage into past predictions, essential for real-time applications
2. **Dilated Convolutions**: Enables exponentially expanding receptive fields without increasing computational complexity
3. **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, TCNs allow parallel processing of input sequences, dramatically reducing training time

**Mathematical Framework**: The TCN employs one-dimensional causal convolution with kernel size k and padding size (k-1), ensuring output length equals input length. For dilated convolutions, the receptive field expands exponentially as:

Receptive Field = 1 + Σᴸᵢ₌₁(k-1) × dᵢ

where L represents number of layers and dᵢ denotes dilation factor at layer i.

**TCN-AA Architecture Design**: The complete system consists of:

- **3 hierarchical TCN layers** with dilation sizes [1, 2, 4] and 50 filters each
- **Temporal attention mechanism** applied at first layer for enhanced feature weighting
- **Causal convolution blocks** with kernel size 15 for extended temporal dependencies
- **Average pooling** across transmitter-receiver pairs for final classification
- **Fully connected network** outputting probabilities for 12 interaction classes

### Advanced Signal Processing and Augmentation Pipeline

**Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**:
- **Packet standardization**: Fixed length at 1500 packets (Np = 1500) from original range [1040, 2249]
- **Normalization**: Data scaled to [-1,1] range for each transmitter-receiver pair
- **Butterworth filtering**: Low-pass filter eliminates high-frequency noise
- **1D-DWT downsampling**: Applied twice, reducing temporal dimension from 1500 to 375 while preserving essential patterns

**Novel Data Augmentation Strategies**: Three complementary techniques address dataset scarcity:

1. **Dropout Augmentation**: Random CSI value masking with probability λ ∈ (0, 0.07) simulating signal loss
2. **Mixed-Label Augmentation**: D = A·(1-ε₁) + B·ε₂ + C·ε₃ where samples B,C have different labels from A
3. **Same-Label Augmentation**: Similar mixing but with identical labels to simulate subject variations

These techniques achieve 3× data expansion while maintaining pattern integrity.

**Temporal Attention Integration**: The attention mechanism adapts transformer-style attention for temporal CSI processing:

Q = W_Q · H, K = W_K · H, V = W_V · H

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(L(QK^T/√d_K))V

where L represents lower triangular masking preserving causal constraints.

### Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis
