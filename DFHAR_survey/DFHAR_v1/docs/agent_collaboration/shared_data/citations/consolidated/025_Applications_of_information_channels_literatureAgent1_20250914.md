### Core Technical Contributions

#### 1. Comprehensive Multi-ViT Architecture Comparative Study
The paper provides the first systematic evaluation of five state-of-the-art Vision Transformer architectures specifically adapted for WiFi CSI-based HAR:

**Vanilla ViT (2021)**:
- **Core Architecture**: Patch embedding → Positional encoding → Multi-head self-attention → MLP blocks
- **Key Innovation**: Treats CSI spectrograms as sequences of image patches
- **Mathematical Foundation**:
  ```
  Given CSI spectrogram x ∈ R^(H×W×C), divided into patches x_p ∈ R^(N×(P²·C))
  where N = HW/P² (number of patches)
  ```
- **Attention Mechanism**: Standard transformer self-attention for global feature extraction

**SimpleViT (Enhanced Vanilla)**:
- **Architectural Improvements**: Global Average Pooling instead of class tokens
- **Training Optimizations**: Fixed 2-D sine-cosine position embeddings, RandAugment, Mixup
- **Performance Gains**: Substantial improvements through seemingly minor modifications
- **Regularization**: Advanced techniques including dropout, stochastic depth, SAM optimization

**DeepViT (Attention Enhancement)**:
- **Revolutionary Reattention Mechanism**:
  ```
  Re-Attention(Q,K,V) = Norm(Softmax(Θ·QK^T/√d))·V
  ```
- **Cross-Head Information Exchange**: Trainable transformation matrix Θ ∈ R^(H×H)
- **Attention Collapse Mitigation**: Addresses model rank degeneration in deeper architectures
- **Dynamic Aggregation**: Creates new attention maps from existing head outputs

**SwinTransformer (Hierarchical Attention)**:
- **Shifted Window Mechanism**: Efficient local attention within non-overlapping windows
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  ẑ^l = W-MSA(LN(ẑ^(l-1))) + ẑ^(l-1)
  z^l = MLP(LN(ẑ^l)) + ẑ^l
  ẑ^(l+1) = SW-MSA(LN(z^l)) + z^l
  ```
- **Cross-Window Connectivity**: Alternating window partitioning configurations
- **Computational Efficiency**: Quadratic scaling reduction through local attention

**CaiT (Class-Attention Transformer)**:
- **Dual-Stage Processing**: Self-attention stage → Class-attention stage
- **Class-Attention Mechanism**:
  ```
  Q = W_q·x_class + b_q
  K = W_k·z + b_k (where z = [x_class, x_patches])
  V = W_v·z + b_v
  ```
- **Information Flow Optimization**: Maximizes patch-to-class embedding transfer
- **Residual-Based Updates**: Dynamic class embedding modification through CA and FFN layers

#### 2. Advanced Mathematical Framework for CSI Processing

**OFDM Signal Modeling**:
```
x_k(t) = Σ(w=1 to W) a_{w,k} exp(j2π(f_c + f_w/T)t)
```
where a_{w,k} represents constellation points, f_w denotes subcarrier frequencies, and f_c is the central frequency.

**Channel State Information Extraction**:
```
y = H ○ x (received signal relationship)
Ĥ ∈ C^W (quantized channel estimation)
x̂ ≈ Ĥ^(-1) ○ y (signal recovery)
```

**Multi-Antenna CSI Generalization**:
For N > 1 antennas, simultaneous acquisition of N distinct CSI measurements H_i enables enhanced spatial diversity and improved sensing accuracy.

**Frequency Domain Analysis**:
```
x(t - γ) ←F→ X(f) · exp(-j2πfτ)
```
The relationship demonstrates how multipath propagation creates complex exponential combinations in frequency domain, enabling CSI-based activity differentiation.
