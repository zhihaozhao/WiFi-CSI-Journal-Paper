## Executive Summary

This paper introduces WiPhase, a revolutionary WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition system that addresses fundamental limitations in existing approaches by leveraging reconstructed CSI phase features through novel two-stream architecture fusion. The work tackles the critical problem that most existing models ignore sub-carrier correlations and rely on inefficient deeper networks for performance improvement. WiPhase achieves breakthrough performance with 98.75% accuracy while maintaining exceptional cross-domain generalization capability (90.57% under combined cross-domain conditions), representing a 40.34% reduction in training time and 46.74% reduction in computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This represents the first comprehensive approach to systematically exploit CSI sub-carrier correlations through reconstructed phase features, establishing new paradigms for efficient and robust WiFi sensing systems.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Revolutionary Architecture and Methodological Innovation

**Two-Stream Fusion Framework**: WiPhase introduces a groundbreaking dual-pathway architecture that separately extracts temporal features and sub-carrier correlation features from reconstructed CSI phase data. This represents a fundamental departure from existing single-stream approaches that inadequately capture the complex relationships between WiFi sub-carriers. The system combines a Gated Pseudo-Siamese Network (GPSiam) for temporal feature extraction with a Dynamic Resolution-based Graph Attention Network (DRGAT) for sub-carrier correlation analysis.

**Mathematical Framework for Phase Reconstruction**: The core innovation lies in CSI Phase Integration Representation (CSI-PIR) construction, which mathematically combines phase difference and phase ratio between adjacent receiving antennas:

```
CSI-PIR: c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,pir = pr^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s · e^(-jΔ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,m)    (13)

Phase Ratio: pr^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s = e^(-j∠c^(ntnr+1)_s,t) / e^(-j∠c^(ntnr)_s,t)    (12)

Phase Difference: Δ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,m = Δ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,t + ΔP_dll + ΔE    (10)
```

This reconstruction eliminates time-varying random phase offsets while preserving activity-related phase information, making CSI-PIR more robust and relevant to human activity changes compared to raw CSI amplitude, phase, or traditional CSI representations.

**Advanced Signal Processing Pipeline**: The system implements sophisticated preprocessing through Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) for activity-related CSI separation and Sparse Signal Representation (SSP) for optimal sub-carrier selection. EEMD adaptively decomposes signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs):

```
c^(ntnr)_s(t) = Σ(n=1 to N) imf_n(t) + r_N(t)    (7)
```

SSP extracts 10 most relevant sub-carriers from 30 original sub-carriers based on phase variance analysis, achieving 3× dimensionality reduction while improving signal-to-noise ratio.

### Gated Pseudo-Siamese Network Innovation

**Temporal Feature Extraction with Causal Constraints**: GPSiam addresses fundamental limitations of RNN-based approaches through right-aligned causal convolution that preserves temporal causality while enabling parallel processing. The network ensures current estimates cannot depend on future inputs: e(h^t|h^1, h^2, ..., h^(t-1)) while achieving O(T) complexity compared to O(T^2) for transformers and O(Th + h^2) for LSTMs.

**Gated Attention Mechanism**: The system combines global max pooling, global average pooling, and gated units with hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid activation functions, implementing quasi-attention mechanisms that can directly assign zero values to unimportant features:

```
Training Objective: L = L_pd + L_pr + L_s
L_pd = -ω_pd Σ_a y^a_pd log(f_pd(h^a_pd; θ_pd))
L_pr = -ω_pr Σ_a y^a_pr log(f_pr(h^a_pr; θ_pr))
L_s = -ω_s Σ_a y^a_s log(f_s(o^a_pd, o^a_pr; θ_pd, θ_pr))    (14)
```

### Dynamic Resolution Graph Attention Network

**Sub-carrier Correlation Modeling**: DRGAT represents the first systematic approach to model CSI sub-carrier correlations through graph neural networks. The CSI phase graph construction utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for edge computation, providing more accurate similarity assessment than Euclidean distance-based methods.

**Dynamic Resolution Architecture**: The multi-resolution approach (R₁ ≤ R₂ ≤ R₃ where 500 ≤ R₁ ≤ R₂ ≤ R₃ ≤ 1000) enables efficient processing by routing samples to appropriate resolution levels, reducing computational complexity while maintaining recognition accuracy for difficult samples.

**Graph Attention Mathematical Framework**: Multi-head attention mechanism for sub-carrier correlation extraction:

```
g'_r = ‖^Q_(q=1) σ(Σ_(γ∈N_r) α^q_rγ W^q g_γ)    (17)
α_rγ = softmax(e_rγ) = exp(e_rγ) / Σ_(μ∈N_r) exp(e_rμ)    (19)
e_rγ = LeakyReLU(W^f ‖[Wg_r‖Wg_γ])    (20)
```

### Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

**Comprehensive Cross-Domain Evaluation**: The experimental framework addresses five critical cross-domain scenarios: cross-environment, cross-location, cross-orientation, cross-user, and combined cross-domain conditions. Evaluation across 7 datasets with 10 volunteers demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

## Comprehensive Analysis

### Abstract Summary
This paper presents SHARP (Sensing Human Activities through Wi-Fi Radio Propagation), a groundbreaking approach for device-free human activity recognition (HAR) that achieves environment and person independence using commodity IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi devices. SHARP addresses the fundamental limitation of existing WiFi sensing systems that fail to generalize across different environments, people, and time periods without extensive retraining.

### Core Technical Contributions

#### 1. Revolutionary Phase Sanitization Algorithm for CFR Processing
SHARP introduces an innovative phase sanitization method that fundamentally advances WiFi sensing capabilities. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on reference antennas or signals, SHARP implements an autonomous phase correction algorithm:

**Mathematical Framework**:
The method decomposes the Channel Frequency Response (CFR) into multi-path contributions using compressed sensing:
```
h = Tr  (CFR decomposition)
```
where T represents path-dependent contributions and r contains path-independent terms.

**Key Innovation**: The algorithm identifies the strongest path component and uses it as a reference to eliminate hardware-induced phase offsets (φ_offs,k), which include:
- Channel Frequency Offset (CFO)
- Phase-Locked Loop offset (PPO)
- Phase Ambiguity (PA)
- Sampling Frequency Offset (SFO)
- Packet Detection Delay (PDD)

This autonomous approach preserves spatial diversity across all antennas, enabling full exploitation of antenna arrays for sensing purposes.

#### 2. Advanced Doppler-Based Feature Extraction
SHARP leverages the micro-Doppler effect to extract environment-independent features from WiFi signals:

**Doppler Computation Process**:
1. **CFR Matrix Construction**: Creates K×N dimensional matrices for observation windows
2. **Fourier Transform Application**: Extracts Doppler information using FMCW radar principles
3. **Velocity Estimation**: Computes scatterer velocities: v_p cos α_p = (uc)/(f_c T_c N_D)

**Environmental Independence**: The Doppler shift naturally separates:
- Static environmental components (walls, furniture)
- Dynamic human movement signatures
- Motion-induced multi-path variations

This separation enables robust activity recognition across different physical environments without retraining.

#### 3. Sophisticated Learning Architecture with Inception Modules
SHARP employs a carefully designed neural network architecture optimized for Doppler spectrogram analysis:

**Network Architecture Components**:
- **Simplified Inception Module**: Extracts multi-scale features using parallel branches with different kernel sizes
- **Multi-branch Processing**: Combines max-pooling and convolutional layers for comprehensive feature extraction
- **Lightweight Design**: 128,535 parameters (significantly smaller than full Inception-v4's 43M parameters)
- **Decision Fusion Strategy**: Combines outputs from multiple antennas for robust classification

**Multi-Scale Feature Extraction**: The Inception module processes:
- Fine-grained motion details (small kernel sizes)
- Coarse-grained activity patterns (large kernel sizes)
- Temporal dynamics across observation windows

#### 4. Comprehensive Environment and Person Independence Framework
SHARP demonstrates unprecedented generalization capabilities across multiple dimensions:

**Independence Validation Scenarios**:
- **Cross-Environment**: Different room geometries and layouts
- **Cross-Person**: Multiple individuals with varying movement characteristics
- **Cross-Day**: Different temporal conditions and environmental states
- **Cross-Setup**: Various antenna configurations and occlusion scenarios

**Robustness Mechanisms**:
1. **Antenna Occlusion Handling**: Maintains performance even with blocked antenna paths
2. **Multi-Environment Validation**: Tested in bedroom, living room, and laboratory settings
3. **Person-Agnostic Training**: Single-person training generalizes to unknown individuals

### Advanced Mathematical Framework

#### 5. Rigorous Multi-Path Signal Modeling
SHARP implements sophisticated mathematical models for WiFi signal propagation:

**Channel Model**:
```
H_k(n) = A_k(n)e^(jφ_k(n)) = Σ(p=0 to P-1) A_p(n)e^(j2π(f_c + k/T)τ_p(n))
```

**Dynamic Path Modeling**:
```
τ_p(n) = (ℓ_p + Δ_p(n))/c
Δ_p(n) = ∫(0 to nT_c) v_p(x) cos α_p(x) dx
```

This rigorous modeling enables accurate extraction of human movement characteristics from complex multi-path environments.

#### 6. Innovative Compressed Sensing Application
The phase sanitization algorithm applies compressed sensing principles to CFR decomposition:

**Optimization Problem**:
```
P1: r = argmin_r̃ ||h - Tr̃||₂² + λ||r̃||₁
```

**Sparsity Exploitation**: Leverages the sparse nature of indoor channel impulse responses to accurately separate multi-path components and identify the strongest reference path.

The work represents a significant paradigm shift from traditional RNN/LSTM-based sequential models to temporal convolutional architectures for WiFi sensing applications. By combining TCN with sophisticated data augmentation techniques and temporal attention mechanisms, the approach achieves remarkable 99.42% accuracy on the HHI dataset, establishing new state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency. This research marks the first application of TCNs to WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition, opening new avenues for efficient temporal modeling in wireless sensing.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architectural Innovation and Design

**Temporal Convolutional Network Foundation**: The core innovation lies in adapting TCN architecture for WiFi CSI processing, replacing traditional sequence-to-sequence models with convolutional approaches. The TCN architecture provides three critical advantages:

1. **Causal Convolutions**: Maintains temporal causality by preventing future information leakage into past predictions, essential for real-time applications
2. **Dilated Convolutions**: Enables exponentially expanding receptive fields without increasing computational complexity
3. **Parallel Processing**: Unlike RNNs, TCNs allow parallel processing of input sequences, dramatically reducing training time

**Mathematical Framework**: The TCN employs one-dimensional causal convolution with kernel size k and padding size (k-1), ensuring output length equals input length. For dilated convolutions, the receptive field expands exponentially as:

Receptive Field = 1 + Σᴸᵢ₌₁(k-1) × dᵢ

where L represents number of layers and dᵢ denotes dilation factor at layer i.

**TCN-AA Architecture Design**: The complete system consists of:

- **3 hierarchical TCN layers** with dilation sizes [1, 2, 4] and 50 filters each
- **Temporal attention mechanism** applied at first layer for enhanced feature weighting
- **Causal convolution blocks** with kernel size 15 for extended temporal dependencies
- **Average pooling** across transmitter-receiver pairs for final classification
- **Fully connected network** outputting probabilities for 12 interaction classes

### Advanced Signal Processing and Augmentation Pipeline

**Comprehensive Data Preprocessing**:
- **Packet standardization**: Fixed length at 1500 packets (Np = 1500) from original range [1040, 2249]
- **Normalization**: Data scaled to [-1,1] range for each transmitter-receiver pair
- **Butterworth filtering**: Low-pass filter eliminates high-frequency noise
- **1D-DWT downsampling**: Applied twice, reducing temporal dimension from 1500 to 375 while preserving essential patterns

**Novel Data Augmentation Strategies**: Three complementary techniques address dataset scarcity:

1. **Dropout Augmentation**: Random CSI value masking with probability λ ∈ (0, 0.07) simulating signal loss
2. **Mixed-Label Augmentation**: D = A·(1-ε₁) + B·ε₂ + C·ε₃ where samples B,C have different labels from A
3. **Same-Label Augmentation**: Similar mixing but with identical labels to simulate subject variations

These techniques achieve 3× data expansion while maintaining pattern integrity.

**Temporal Attention Integration**: The attention mechanism adapts transformer-style attention for temporal CSI processing:

Q = W_Q · H, K = W_K · H, V = W_V · H

Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(L(QK^T/√d_K))V

where L represents lower triangular masking preserving causal constraints.

### Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

**Dataset Characteristics**: Validation performed on HHI (Human-Human Interaction) dataset containing:
- **64 subjects** in 40 distinct pairs
- **12 interaction activities**: approaching, departing, handshaking, high five, hugging, kicking (left/right leg), pointing (left/right hand), punching (left/right hand), pushing

- **Layer-specific optimization**: Attention applied only at first layer provides optimal performance/computational trade-off
- **Convergence acceleration**: 80-epoch improvement in reaching 99% accuracy

```
where a_{w,k} represents constellation points, f_w denotes subcarrier frequencies, and f_c is the central frequency.

**Channel State Information Extraction**:
```
y = H ○ x (received signal relationship)
Ĥ ∈ C^W (quantized channel estimation)
x̂ ≈ Ĥ^(-1) ○ y (signal recovery)
```

**Multi-Antenna CSI Generalization**:
For N > 1 antennas, simultaneous acquisition of N distinct CSI measurements H_i enables enhanced spatial diversity and improved sensing accuracy.

**Frequency Domain Analysis**:

## Executive Summary

This research introduces MultiMesh, a groundbreaking multi-subject 3D human mesh construction system based on commodity WiFi devices. The system represents a paradigm shift from single-subject to multi-subject scenarios in WiFi-based sensing, addressing critical limitations in existing approaches. MultiMesh leverages an L-shaped antenna array to generate two-dimensional angle of arrival (2D AoA) of reflected signals for subject separation in physical space, while incorporating angle of departure (AoD) and time of flight (ToF) to enhance resolvability for precise separation of close subjects. The system achieves remarkable performance with an average vertex error of 4cm for multiple users across diverse environments and occlusion scenarios, demonstrating substantial advancement over traditional computer vision-based approaches.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing Architecture

**Four-Dimensional Spatial Information Extraction**: The core innovation lies in jointly estimating four-dimensional information including azimuth, elevation, AoD, and ToF to significantly improve the resolvability of commodity WiFi sensing. The mathematical framework includes:

**2D AoA Estimation**: The system forms an L-shaped antenna array to extract spatial information:
```
Φ_x(φ_l, θ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ sin(φ_l) cos(θ_l))
Φ_z(φ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ cos(φ_l))
```

where Φ_x and Φ_z represent phase differences between subarrays across X and Z axes respectively.

**AoD Integration**: Multiple transmitting antennas generate angle of departure information:
```
Ψ(ω) = e^(-j2πfd sin(ω)/c)
```

**ToF Enhancement**: OFDM subcarriers provide time-of-flight information:
```
Ω(τ) = e^(-j2πf_δτ_l/c)
```

**Joint 4D Estimation**: The unified spatial spectrum function maximizes multi-dimensional information:
```
P(θ,φ,ω,τ) = 1/(A^H(θ,φ,ω,τ)E_N E_N^H A(θ,φ,ω,τ))
```

### Advanced Subject Separation Techniques

**Multi-Subject Resolution Enhancement**: The system dramatically improves resolvability through multi-dimensional information fusion. Simulation results demonstrate that incorporating AoD and ToF reduces inseparability probability by factors of 2.2 and 10 respectively for subjects separated by 60cm.

**Indirect Reflection Mitigation**: Sophisticated algorithms distinguish direct from indirect reflections using propagation path analysis. The system leverages the insight that indirect reflections have longer propagation paths and different angles compared to direct reflections.

**Near-Far Problem Solution**: Dynamic tracking algorithms utilize motion coherence to distinguish weak signals from faraway subjects against noise, employing DeepSORT framework with appearance and motion branches.

### Deep Learning Mesh Construction Framework

**Multi-Regional Body Analysis**: The framework divides the human body into five regions (torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg) for specialized deformation learning:

**CNN-GRU-Attention Architecture**:
- CNN extracts spatial features from 2D AoA images
- GRU captures temporal dependencies across consecutive frames
- Self-attention mechanism weights important frames dynamically
- SMPL model generates final 3D mesh with realistic human representation

**Loss Function Optimization**:
```
L_SMPL = λ_J L_p + λ_V L_s
Loss = (1/F) Σ ||K - GT(K)||_L1
```

## Mathematical Framework & Algorithmic Contributions

### Comprehensive Data Calibration

**Phase Offset Correction**: Optimal linear fit method removes random phase offsets:
```
σ = argmin_α Σ(Ψ(x,y,z) + 2πf_δ(z-1)α + β)²
```

**Static Reflection Subtraction**: Weighted frame subtraction eliminates static environment interference:
```
F_r = F_c - a₁F₁ - a₂F₂ - ... - a_nF_n
```

where weights a₁=0.4, a₂=0.3, a₃=0.2, a₄=0.1 for consecutive frames.

### Multi-Subject Detection Framework

**YOLACT-Based Detection**: Real-time instance segmentation model generates prototype masks and combines mask coefficients for subject detection in Azimuth-ToF and AoD-ToF profiles.

**Adaptive Elevation Filtering**: Range-dependent elevation scope filtering eliminates interferential elevations based on human height constraints (1.5m-2.0m) and ToF information.

## Experimental Validation & Performance Metrics

## Executive Summary

This paper presents DPSense, a groundbreaking sensing framework that addresses the fundamental challenge of heterogeneous sensing quality within WiFi-based gesture recognition systems. The work introduces a novel theoretical model linking gesture signals with ambient noise, from which the authors derive a unique Error of Dynamic Phase index (EDP-index) to quantify signal sensing quality. The framework achieves remarkable improvements in gesture recognition accuracy, with up to 94% average performance and significant enhancements over state-of-the-art methods across different locations and orientations. This represents a paradigm shift from treating all signal segments uniformly to quality-aware signal processing that maximizes high-quality segment contribution while minimizing low-quality segment impact.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Signal Quality Characterization Framework**: The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing and mathematically modeling the phenomenon of heterogeneous sensing quality within individual gestures. Unlike prior work that treats all signal segments uniformly, this research identifies that different segments of the same gesture exhibit vastly different sensing qualities based on location and orientation relative to WiFi transceivers. The authors establish that signal quality varies according to how hand motion intersects with Fresnel zones, creating segments where gesture signals dominate versus segments where ambient noise overwhelms the gesture signal.

**Mathematical Foundation for Quality Assessment**: The paper develops a rigorous mathematical model decomposing the received CSI signal into static components, gesture signals, and ambient noise. The model establishes that ambient noise follows a zero-mean, isotropic bi-variate normal distribution, providing theoretical foundations for quality quantification. This mathematical rigor enables the derivation of the sensing quality metric η(t) = (Δθ(t) - Δφ(t))/Δφ(t), capturing the relationship between measured phase variations and true gesture-induced phase variations.

**Error of Dynamic Phase Index (EDP-index)**: The core algorithmic innovation is the EDP-index metric, derived from statistical analysis of phase variation distributions. The metric is calculated as EDP = (n-1)(Δθ)²/Σ(Δθᵢ - Δθ)², providing a quantitative measure of sensing quality that enables automatic classification of signal segments into 'valid' and 'invalid' categories for differential processing.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Quality-Oriented Signal Processing Pipeline**: The DPSense framework implements a sophisticated three-stage processing pipeline: (1) EDP-index calculation and signal quality classification, (2) adaptive processing for valid signals through multi-carrier alignment and ambient noise alleviation, and (3) motion speculation for invalid signals using learned patterns. This architecture enables robust gesture recognition across diverse environmental conditions and user positions.

**Multi-Carrier Signal Enhancement**: For valid signals, the system implements innovative multi-carrier alignment techniques that amplify gesture signal components while minimizing ambient noise impact. The approach leverages frequency-selective fading properties where ambient noise components across different subcarriers are independent, enabling constructive combination of gesture signals while random superposition reduces noise impact.

**Cross-Domain Adaptability**: The framework demonstrates exceptional cross-domain generalization capabilities, maintaining consistent performance across different locations and orientations. The quality-aware processing inherently adapts to environmental variations by dynamically adjusting the contribution of different signal segments based on their sensing quality rather than applying uniform processing.

## Mathematical Framework Analysis

### Signal Modeling and Theoretical Foundation

**Comprehensive CSI Decomposition**: The paper establishes a rigorous mathematical foundation with the CSI model:
```
H(f,t) = Hs(f) + A(f,t)e^(-j2πl(t)/λ) + E(f,t)
```
where the static component Hs(f) represents environmental reflections, A(f,t)e^(-j2πl(t)/λ) represents gesture signals, and E(f,t) represents ambient noise including both channel-induced Gaussian noise and dynamic multipath signals from other moving objects.

**Statistical Analysis of Sensing Quality**: The authors provide comprehensive statistical analysis demonstrating that the variance of sensing quality η(t) can be estimated as D(η(t)) = D(Δθ(t))/[E(Δθ(t))]². This relationship enables practical quality estimation using only measured phase variations, making the approach implementable on commodity WiFi devices without requiring separation of gesture signals from noise.

**Convergence and Theoretical Guarantees**: The mathematical framework provides theoretical guarantees for the EDP-index calculation, establishing that higher EDP values correspond to better sensing quality. The paper includes rigorous derivation showing that E(Δθ(t)) = Δφ(t), enabling practical estimation of sensing quality variance using measurable quantities.

## Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### Comprehensive Multi-Scenario Evaluation

**Cross-Location Performance Excellence**: Extensive experimental validation demonstrates remarkable robustness across five different locations with accuracy improvements of 70% over WiFinger, 9.7% over FingerDraw, and 7.2% over WiGesture. The system maintains 94%+ average accuracy across all tested scenarios, with particular strength in challenging cross-domain settings where traditional methods experience significant degradation.

**Orientation-Independent Recognition**: The framework shows exceptional stability across different gesture orientations, with improvements of 17.8% over FingerDraw and 12.2% over WiFinger when comparing worst-case scenarios across orientations. This represents a fundamental advance in addressing the orientation dependency problem that has limited practical deployment of WiFi gesture recognition systems.

**Multi-Gesture Set Validation**: Comprehensive evaluation across three distinct gesture sets (basic gestures: 97.2%, digits: 96.8%, mathematical symbols: 94.7%) demonstrates the generality of the approach. The framework maintains high performance across gesture complexity levels, from simple directional movements to complex multi-stroke patterns requiring sophisticated motion tracking.

### Environmental Robustness and Real-World Performance

**Multi-Environment Stability**: Testing across diverse indoor environments (office rooms, living rooms, meeting rooms) with varying multipath characteristics shows minimal performance degradation. The quality-aware processing inherently adapts to environmental noise levels and multipath conditions, maintaining consistent recognition accuracy regardless of deployment location.

**User Diversity and Practical Deployment**: Evaluation with 12 users of varying demographics (ages 19-40, 4 females, 8 males) demonstrates user-independent performance with 96.4% average accuracy. The framework successfully handles variations in hand size, gesture execution style, and movement patterns that typically challenge WiFi sensing systems.

**Interference Resilience**: Systematic evaluation of interference scenarios including human movement, spinning fans, and concurrent activities shows graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure. The EDP-index effectively identifies periods of strong interference and adapts processing accordingly, maintaining functionality in realistic deployment scenarios.

## Cross-Domain Generalization and Theoretical Significance

### Domain Adaptation Mechanisms

**Location-Independent Feature Extraction**: The quality-aware processing inherently creates location-independent features by emphasizing signal segments with high sensing quality regardless of absolute position. This approach moves beyond traditional feature engineering to adaptive feature selection based on signal characteristics, achieving superior cross-domain performance.

**Orientation-Adaptive Recognition**: The framework's ability to handle varying gesture orientations stems from the fundamental insight that orientation affects sensing quality in predictable ways. By quantifying these effects through the EDP-index, the system can maintain recognition accuracy even when gesture segments have vastly different sensing characteristics.

**Theoretical Foundation for Generalization**: The mathematical model provides theoretical explanation for why quality-aware processing achieves superior generalization. By focusing on signal segments where gesture signals dominate ambient noise, the approach naturally selects features that are more likely to be consistent across different deployment conditions.

## Practical Implementation and Deployment Considerations

### Real-World System Design

**Commodity Hardware Compatibility**: The framework is designed for implementation on commodity WiFi devices using standard Intel 5300 NICs and open-source CSI extraction tools. The computational requirements are modest, with processing times of 0.4 seconds for 1 second of CSI data at 400Hz sampling rate, enabling real-time operation on standard laptop hardware.

**Multi-Transceiver Configuration**: The system employs a practical two-pair transceiver setup that provides sufficient spatial diversity for quality assessment while maintaining reasonable deployment complexity. The configuration balances sensing coverage with implementation practicality, making the approach suitable for consumer applications.

**Adaptive Parameter Selection**: The framework includes adaptive mechanisms for threshold selection and quality classification that adjust to local environmental conditions. This adaptability reduces deployment complexity and improves robustness across diverse real-world conditions.

## Critical Assessment and Limitations

### Technical Constraints and Challenges

**Single-User Limitation**: The current framework assumes single-user gesture recognition scenarios and does not address multi-user simultaneous gesture recognition. While this limitation is acknowledged, it represents a significant constraint for applications requiring concurrent multi-user interaction.

**Environmental Noise Sensitivity**: Although the framework shows remarkable robustness to typical ambient noise, extreme electromagnetic interference or very weak gesture signals can still overwhelm the quality-aware processing. The approach works best in environments where gesture signals achieve at least minimal signal-to-noise ratios.

**Computational Overhead**: The quality assessment and adaptive processing introduce computational overhead compared to simple signal processing approaches. While the authors demonstrate real-time capability, the additional processing may limit deployment on resource-constrained devices.

### Methodological Considerations

**Quality Threshold Selection**: The framework requires empirical determination of quality thresholds for signal classification. While the paper provides guidance for threshold selection, optimal parameters may require environment-specific tuning for peak performance.

**Gesture Complexity Limits**: The evaluation focuses primarily on relatively simple gesture patterns (digits, symbols, basic movements). Performance with highly complex, multi-stroke gestures or rapid gesture sequences may require additional validation.

## Future Research Directions and Extensions

### Algorithmic Enhancement Opportunities

**Multi-User Extension**: Future research could explore extending the quality-aware processing to multi-user scenarios through advanced signal separation techniques or quality-based user discrimination. This would require sophisticated mathematical frameworks for handling overlapping gesture signals.

**Deep Learning Integration**: The EDP-index and quality-aware processing could be integrated with deep learning architectures to create end-to-end trainable systems that learn optimal quality assessment and signal processing strategies for specific deployment scenarios.

**Advanced Noise Modeling**: Extension to more sophisticated ambient noise models could improve performance in challenging electromagnetic environments or scenarios with non-Gaussian interference patterns.

### System Integration and Scaling

**Edge Computing Optimization**: Integration with edge computing platforms could enable distributed quality assessment and processing, reducing computational load on individual devices while maintaining real-time performance.

**Multi-Modal Fusion**: The quality-aware processing framework could be extended to incorporate multiple sensing modalities, creating comprehensive gesture recognition systems that adaptively weight different sensing channels based on their quality characteristics.

## Research Impact and Significance

This work represents a transformative contribution to WiFi sensing research by introducing the fundamental concept of signal quality characterization within gesture recognition systems. The theoretical framework for modeling ambient noise and gesture signal relationships provides new foundations for robust wireless sensing system design.

## Executive Summary

This cutting-edge research addresses the fundamental challenge of WiFi-based human activity recognition performance degradation when deployed across diverse environmental conditions. The authors introduce AdaptNet, a revolutionary adaptive deep learning framework that employs meta-learning principles and neural architecture search to automatically discover and adapt optimal network configurations for specific deployment environments. The framework demonstrates remarkable cross-environment generalization capabilities, achieving accuracy improvements of up to 23.7% compared to traditional fixed-architecture approaches when evaluated across 15 diverse indoor environments spanning residential, office, and public spaces.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Meta-Learning Architecture Adaptation**: The fundamental innovation lies in treating cross-environment WiFi sensing as a meta-learning problem where the system learns to rapidly adapt to new environments with minimal data requirements. Unlike conventional approaches that require extensive retraining for each new deployment, AdaptNet leverages Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) principles specifically adapted for WiFi channel characteristics. The framework learns a set of initial parameters that can be quickly fine-tuned for new environments through few-shot adaptation procedures.

**Neural Architecture Search for WiFi Sensing**: The core algorithmic contribution introduces environment-aware neural architecture search (EA-NAS) that automatically discovers optimal network topologies for specific WiFi channel characteristics. The system evaluates architectural components including convolutional kernel sizes, attention mechanisms, and temporal modeling modules against environment-specific metrics such as multipath fading patterns, interference levels, and spatial complexity. The mathematical formulation employs differentiable architecture search:

```
α* = argmax_α Σ(e=1 to E) λ_e * Accuracy(A(α), D_e)
A(α) = Σ(i,j) α_i,j * O_i,j(x)
where O_i,j represents operations and α_i,j are architecture weights
```

**Dynamic Feature Extraction Pipeline**: To address the varying signal characteristics across different environments, the authors develop a dynamic feature extraction pipeline that adapts preprocessing strategies based on real-time channel assessment. The system employs reinforcement learning to optimize feature extraction parameters including window sizes, frequency domain transformations, and noise filtering strategies tailored to specific deployment scenarios.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Environment Classification and Adaptation**: The framework implements a sophisticated environment classification system that automatically categorizes deployment scenarios based on CSI characteristics and selects appropriate adaptation strategies. The classification employs a hierarchical approach that first identifies broad categories (residential, office, industrial) and then fine-tunes for specific spatial configurations and interference patterns.

**Progressive Adaptation Mechanism**: The system design incorporates progressive adaptation strategies that continuously improve performance as more data becomes available from the target environment. Initial deployment relies on meta-learned initialization, followed by rapid few-shot adaptation, and finally long-term fine-tuning for optimal performance. The mathematical framework ensures that adaptation preserves previously learned knowledge while incorporating environment-specific optimizations:

```
θ_new = θ_meta - α∇_θ L_target(θ_meta, D_support)

**Paper ID**: 54

## Executive Summary

This paper presents ConTransEn, a novel ensemble deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Vision Transformer (ViT) for WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) based human activity recognition. The research addresses critical limitations of existing methods that struggle to achieve good parallelism while learning both global and fine-grained features. Through innovative integration of CNN spatial feature extraction, ViT temporal dependency modeling via self-attention mechanisms, and bagging ensemble learning, the proposed approach achieves exceptional recognition accuracy of 99.41% on the UT-HAR dataset, surpassing all existing solutions.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Architectural Innovation and Design

The ConTransEn model represents a significant advancement in WiFi-based human activity recognition through its sophisticated multi-component architecture:

**CNN-ViT Hybrid Architecture**: The model employs a two-stage feature extraction paradigm where CNN initially processes raw CSI sequences to extract spatial features while reducing dimensional complexity from 1×250×90 to 64×4×4. The CNN module incorporates 16 convolutional blocks organized into four layers with residual connections, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions. This spatial feature extraction stage is crucial for capturing local patterns and spatial relationships in CSI data that correspond to different human activities.

**Vision Transformer Integration**: Following spatial feature extraction, the model leverages a ViT encoder-only architecture for temporal feature modeling. Unlike traditional RNN-based approaches that process sequences sequentially, the ViT module utilizes self-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in parallel, significantly improving training efficiency. The self-attention computation follows the standard formula: Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√dk)·V, where the scaling factor √dk prevents gradient vanishing during training.

**Positional Embedding and Multi-Head Attention**: The ViT module incorporates learnable positional embeddings to preserve temporal sequence information, which is critical for activity recognition tasks. Multi-head attention mechanisms enable the model to focus on different aspects of the input sequence simultaneously, with experimental results showing optimal performance using 8 attention heads and 5 encoder layers.

### Ensemble Learning Strategy

**Bagging Algorithm Implementation**: To enhance model robustness and reduce overfitting risks, the authors implement a bagging ensemble strategy using bootstrap sampling. Three homogeneous ConTransEn models are trained on different bootstrap samples of the original training set, and their predictions are combined using soft voting. This approach averages predicted probabilities across models, selecting the class with highest average probability as the final prediction.

**Soft Voting Mechanism**: The ensemble prediction process involves averaging probability distributions from multiple base models rather than simple majority voting, providing more nuanced decision-making that leverages the confidence levels of individual model predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that bagging improves average recognition accuracy by 3.86% on the Widar dataset compared to single model performance.

### Advanced Signal Processing Pipeline

**CSI Data Preprocessing**: The paper implements sophisticated denoising techniques including Hampel filtering for outlier removal and moving average filtering for smoothing. These preprocessing steps are essential for handling the inherent noise and interference present in WiFi CSI measurements, particularly in complex indoor environments with multipath effects.

**Dynamic Time Warping Feature Extraction**: For presence detection applications, the authors employ Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to compute similarity measures between test sequences and empty room baselines. This approach generates 234-dimensional feature vectors corresponding to individual subcarriers, enabling robust distinction between occupied and unoccupied spaces.

## Performance Analysis and Validation

### Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation

**UT-HAR Dataset Performance**: The model achieves exceptional results on the UT-HAR dataset, which contains seven daily activities performed by multiple participants in controlled indoor environments. The 99.41% average recognition accuracy represents significant improvement over existing methods, with individual activity recognition rates exceeding 99.5% for five activities and surpassing 95% for the challenging "Sit down" and "Stand up" activities.

**Cross-Dataset Validation**: Evaluation on the Widar3.0 gesture recognition dataset (22 gestures, 16 volunteers, multiple environments) demonstrates model generalization capabilities, achieving 85.09% recognition accuracy on environment-independent Body-coordinate Velocity Profile (BVP) features. This cross-domain validation confirms the model's ability to handle diverse WiFi sensing scenarios.

**Ablation Studies and Component Analysis**: Comprehensive ablation studies validate each architectural component's contribution. ROC curve analysis shows that the CNN+ViT combination significantly outperforms individual CNN (AUC=0.9905) or ViT (AUC=0.9905) models, with the full ConTransEn ensemble achieving AUC=0.9999. Five-fold cross-validation results demonstrate consistent performance with 99.47% average accuracy across different data partitions.

### Comparative Analysis with State-of-the-Art

- **SAE (Sparse Autoencoder)**: 86.25% accuracy
- **LSTM**: 90.5% accuracy
- **CNN-BiLSTM**: 93.08% accuracy
- **ABLSTM (Attention-based BiLSTM)**: 97.19% accuracy
- **ConTransEn (Proposed)**: 99.41% accuracy

The progressive improvement demonstrates the effectiveness of combining CNN spatial processing, Transformer temporal modeling, and ensemble learning strategies.

## Critical Analysis and Research Impact

### Strengths and Innovative Contributions

The research addresses fundamental limitations in existing WiFi CSI-based HAR systems through several key innovations. The CNN-ViT hybrid architecture effectively combines the spatial feature extraction capabilities of convolutional networks with the parallel processing and long-range dependency modeling of Transformers. This combination overcomes the sequential processing limitations of RNN-based approaches while maintaining superior feature extraction capabilities.

The self-attention mechanism implementation specifically addresses the limited receptive field problem of CNN-only approaches, enabling the model to consider global sequence context when making predictions. The multi-head attention structure allows simultaneous focus on different temporal aspects of human activities, providing richer feature representations than traditional sequential processing methods.

The bagging ensemble strategy represents a practical approach to improving model robustness in real-world deployment scenarios where CSI measurements contain significant environmental noise and interference. By training multiple models on bootstrap samples and combining their predictions, the system achieves more reliable performance across diverse conditions.

### Technical Limitations and Challenges

Despite impressive performance, the proposed approach exhibits certain limitations that constrain its immediate practical deployment. The model complexity, with 73.32M parameters, significantly exceeds simpler alternatives, requiring substantial computational resources during training and inference. While the authors report reasonable inference times (0.0032 seconds per sample), the memory requirements may limit deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

The evaluation methodology, while comprehensive within its scope, focuses primarily on controlled indoor environments with limited environmental variability. The UT-HAR dataset collection in a single room configuration may not adequately represent the environmental diversity encountered in real-world WiFi sensing applications, potentially limiting generalization to diverse deployment scenarios.

The model's dependence on high-quality CSI measurements assumes consistent WiFi hardware capabilities and stable network conditions. Variations in antenna configurations, frequency bands, or transmission power could significantly impact performance, requiring additional robustness mechanisms for practical deployment.

### Research Implications and Future Directions

This work establishes important precedents for integrating modern deep learning architectures with WiFi sensing applications. The successful demonstration of Transformer-based temporal modeling in CSI analysis opens new research directions for attention-based sensing systems, potentially applicable to other RF sensing modalities beyond WiFi.

The comprehensive evaluation methodology, including ablation studies, cross-validation, and multi-dataset validation, provides a robust framework for evaluating future WiFi sensing systems. The attention mechanism visualization and component contribution analysis offer valuable insights for designing interpretable sensing systems.

The ensemble learning integration demonstrates practical approaches for improving system reliability in noisy sensing environments, which is crucial for real-world deployment of ambient sensing technologies.

## Technical Specifications and Implementation Details

**Model Architecture**: The CNN module processes input sequences through 16 convolutional blocks with skip connections, reducing spatial dimensions while extracting local features. The ViT encoder employs 5 layers with 8 attention heads, processing 64×4×4 feature maps from CNN output. The final classification layer maps extracted features to activity classes.

**Training Configuration**: Models are trained using Adam optimizer with 0.0001 learning rate, batch size 64, for 50 epochs on UT-HAR dataset. For Widar3.0 evaluation, SGDM optimizer with 0.001 learning rate and 0.9 momentum is employed for 30 epochs with batch size 32.

**Computational Requirements**: The complete model requires 73.32M parameters with 3340.95 FLOPs for inference. Training utilizes mixed-precision techniques with the 'apex' library to reduce memory consumption and accelerate convergence.

## Conclusion

The ConTransEn model represents a significant advancement in WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition, successfully addressing key limitations of existing approaches through innovative architectural design and ensemble learning strategies. The combination of CNN spatial processing, Transformer temporal modeling, and bagging ensemble techniques achieves state-of-the-art performance while providing practical solutions for noise robustness and parallel processing efficiency.

While computational complexity and environmental generalization challenges remain, the demonstrated performance improvements and comprehensive evaluation methodology establish this work as an important contribution to ambient sensing research. The successful integration of modern deep learning architectures with traditional signal processing techniques provides a foundation for developing next-generation wireless sensing systems.

For DFHAR survey integration, this work exemplifies advanced deep learning approaches that leverage both spatial and temporal feature extraction for robust activity recognition. The attention mechanism implementation and ensemble learning strategies offer valuable insights for designing high-performance, reliable ambient sensing systems suitable for diverse deployment scenarios.

## Executive Summary

This essential research addresses the critical security vulnerabilities and robustness limitations that threaten the reliable deployment of WiFi-based human activity recognition systems in security-sensitive environments. The authors introduce SecureHAR, a comprehensive defense framework that combines adversarial training, signal authentication, and anomaly detection to protect against sophisticated attacks while maintaining robust performance under environmental variations and system perturbations. The framework demonstrates exceptional resilience against state-of-the-art attacks, reducing attack success rates from 89.3% to 12.7% while maintaining 94.2% accuracy under normal conditions and 87.8% accuracy under various environmental disturbances.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Multi-Layer Security Architecture**: The fundamental innovation lies in developing a comprehensive multi-layer security framework that addresses vulnerabilities at the signal processing, feature extraction, and classification levels simultaneously. Unlike previous approaches that focus on individual attack vectors, SecureHAR provides holistic protection against coordinated attacks that might exploit multiple system components. The framework employs defense-in-depth principles adapted specifically for the unique characteristics of WiFi sensing systems.

**Adversarial Training with Domain-Specific Perturbations**: The core algorithmic contribution introduces specialized adversarial training techniques that generate realistic attack scenarios specific to WiFi channel characteristics. The system creates adversarial examples that respect the physical constraints of wireless propagation, ensuring that the defense mechanisms are effective against practical attacks rather than only theoretical perturbations:

```
Adversarial_CSI = CSI_original + δ * Physical_Constraint_Mask
where δ = argmax_||δ||≤ε L(f_θ(CSI_original + δ), y_true)
Physical_Constraint_Mask enforces wireless propagation physics
```

**Dynamic Authentication and Validation**: The framework incorporates real-time signal authentication mechanisms that verify the integrity and authenticity of WiFi channel measurements. The system employs cryptographic techniques combined with physical layer characteristics to detect spoofed or manipulated CSI data before it can affect activity recognition decisions.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Hierarchical Anomaly Detection**: The system architecture implements multi-scale anomaly detection that operates at different temporal and spatial resolutions to identify various types of attacks and environmental disturbances. The hierarchical approach enables detection of both subtle, long-term manipulation attacks and sudden, aggressive interference:

```
Anomaly_Score = α × Temporal_Anomaly(CSI_sequence) +
                β × Spatial_Anomaly(CSI_subcarriers) +
                γ × Statistical_Anomaly(CSI_distribution)
Alert_Level = threshold_function(Anomaly_Score, Historical_Baseline)
```

**Adaptive Defense Mechanism**: The framework incorporates adaptive defense strategies that modify protection parameters based on detected threat levels and environmental conditions. The system automatically adjusts sensitivity, filtering parameters, and authentication requirements to balance security protection with sensing performance.

**Secure Communication Protocols**: The system design includes secure communication protocols for multi-device sensing scenarios, ensuring that collaborative sensing networks maintain security even when individual nodes are compromised. The framework employs Byzantine fault tolerance and secure aggregation to maintain system integrity.

## Mathematical Framework Analysis

### Security-Performance Optimization Theory

**Game-Theoretic Attack Modeling**: The mathematical framework employs game-theoretic models to analyze the interaction between attackers and defense mechanisms, enabling optimal defense strategy selection. The analysis considers both rational attackers who seek to maximize attack effectiveness while minimizing detection risk, and adversarial attackers who aim to disrupt system operation:

```
Nash_Equilibrium: (σ*_defender, σ*_attacker) where
U_defender(σ*_defender, σ*_attacker) ≥ U_defender(σ_defender, σ*_attacker)
U_attacker(σ*_defender, σ*_attacker) ≥ U_attacker(σ*_defender, σ_attacker)
```

**Robustness Quantification**: The framework provides mathematical formulations for quantifying system robustness under various threat models and environmental conditions. The analysis establishes theoretical bounds on performance degradation under different attack scenarios and provides guarantees for minimum system performance levels.

### Adversarial Learning and Defense Theory

**Certified Defense Guarantees**: The mathematical analysis provides certified defense guarantees through techniques adapted from adversarial machine learning research. The framework establishes mathematical proofs that certain classes of attacks cannot succeed regardless of attacker sophistication, providing strong security assurances for critical applications:

```
Certified_Radius_r: ∀ ||δ|| ≤ r, f_θ(x + δ) = f_θ(x)
where r is computed through convex relaxation and interval bounds
```

**Differential Privacy for Activity Recognition**: The framework incorporates differential privacy mechanisms that protect individual activity patterns while maintaining classification accuracy. The approach prevents inference attacks that might reveal sensitive behavioral information from WiFi sensing data.

## Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### Comprehensive Attack Resistance Evaluation

**Multi-Vector Attack Assessment**: The experimental validation encompasses diverse attack scenarios including signal injection attacks, replay attacks, adversarial perturbation attacks, and coordination attacks involving multiple compromised devices.

## 🧮 Pattern Recognition核心数学框架

### 数学建模严格性要求
基于期刊历年发表论文分析，Pattern Recognition对数学严格性的核心要求：

#### 1. 优化理论与收敛性分析
```latex
算法收敛性: \lim_{t \to \infty} ||\theta^{(t)} - \theta^*|| = 0
收敛速率: ||\theta^{(t+1)} - \theta^*|| \leq \rho ||\theta^{(t)} - \theta^*||, 0 < \rho < 1
全局最优性: \forall \theta, L(\theta^*) \leq L(\theta)
```

#### 2. 统计学习理论基础
```latex
PAC学习框架: P(R(\hat{h}) - R^*(h) \leq \epsilon) \geq 1 - \delta
VC维界限: R(\hat{h}) \leq \hat{R}(\hat{h}) + \sqrt{\frac{d \ln(2m/d) + \ln(4/\delta)}{2m}}
Rademacher复杂度: \mathcal{R}_m(\mathcal{F}) = E_{\sigma} \sup_{f \in \mathcal{F}} \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^m \sigma_i f(x_i)
```

#### 3. 泛化界限推导
```latex
泛化界限: R(h) - \hat{R}(h) \leq \mathcal{R}_m(\mathcal{H}) + \sqrt{\frac{\ln(2/\delta)}{2m}}
一致收敛: \sup_{h \in \mathcal{H}} |R(h) - \hat{R}(h)| \leq \epsilon
经验风险最小化: \hat{h} = \arg\min_{h \in \mathcal{H}} \hat{R}(h)

## 🧮 **数学建模框架提取**

### **核心数学理论:**

#### **1. 家族错误率控制数学框架:**
```
Family-Wise Error Rate (FWER) Control:
FWER = P(⋃ᵢ₌₁ᵐ {pᵢ ≤ αᵢ} | H₀^global) ≤ α

Bonferroni Correction:
α_Bonferroni = α/m

Holm-Bonferroni Sequential Procedure:
αᵢ = α/(m-i+1), i = 1, 2, ..., m

Šidák Correction:
α_Šidák = 1 - (1-α)^(1/m)

其中:
- m: 同时进行的假设检验数量
- α: 整体显著性水平
- pᵢ: 第i个检验的p值
- H₀^global: 全局零假设
```

#### **2. 错误发现率控制数学理论:**
```
False Discovery Rate (FDR) Control:
FDR = E[V/(R ∨ 1)] ≤ α

Benjamini-Hochberg Procedure:
α_BH^(i) = (i/m) · α

Benjamini-Yekutieli Procedure (Dependency):
α_BY^(i) = (i/m) · (α/c(m))
c(m) = Σⱼ₌₁ᵐ 1/j

Storey's q-value Calculation:
q(pᵢ) = minₜ≥pᵢ π₀(t) · t/F̂(t)

其中:
- V: 错误发现数量
- R: 总拒绝假设数量
- π₀(t): 真零假设比例估计
- F̂(t): p值分布函数估计
```

#### **3. 自适应多重校正算法:**
```
Adaptive Correction Framework:
α_adaptive^(i) = f(ρᵢⱼ, m, α) · α_base^(i)

Correlation Structure Matrix:
Σ = [1      ρ₁₂    ...  ρ₁ᵐ]
    [ρ₂₁    1      ...  ρ₂ᵐ]
    [⋮      ⋮      ⋱   ⋮  ]
    [ρᵐ₁    ρᵐ₂    ...  1 ]

Adaptive Threshold Selection:
t* = argmaxₜ {#{pᵢ ≤ t}/(m·t) - λ(Σ,t)}

Dependency-Aware Correction:
α_corrected^(i) = α · g(eigenvalues(Σ), i/m)

其中:
- ρᵢⱼ: 检验i和j之间的相关系数
- λ(Σ,t): 依赖结构惩罚项
- g(·): 特征值依赖的校正函数
```

#### **4. 排列检验多重校正理论:**
```
Permutation-Based Multiple Testing:
T_max^(b) = maxᵢ Tᵢ^(b)

Step-Down Max-T Procedure:
p_corrected^(i) = (1/B) Σᵦ I(T_max^(b) ≥ Tᵢ)

Bootstrap Confidence Intervals:
CI_bootstrap = [θ̂ - z_α/2 · SE_bootstrap, θ̂ + z_α/2 · SE_bootstrap]

Cross-Validation Multiple Testing:
μ̂_CV = (1/K) Σₖ₌₁ᴷ μ̂ₖ
SE_CV = √[1/(K(K-1)) Σₖ₌₁ᴷ (μ̂ₖ - μ̂_CV)²]

其中:
- B: 排列次数
- T_max^(b): 第b次排列的最大检验统计量
