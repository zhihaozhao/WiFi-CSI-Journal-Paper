### Core Algorithmic Contributions

**Multi-Stage Neural Network Architecture**: AiFi implements a sophisticated cascade of specialized neural networks, each designed with domain-specific WiFi knowledge integration:

1. **Feature Extraction Networks**: Dual-pathway extraction from interfered/non-interfered channel estimations

- Demodulation functionality integrated into network layers

**Interference Pattern Recognition Algorithm**:
- Identifies non-linear phase variations in pilot signals caused by interference
- Exploits dual-domain manifestation (time/frequency) for robust characterization
- Uses differential analysis between interfered/clean channel estimations

**Computational Efficiency**: Achieves sub-1ms inference time through batch processing optimization and WiFi-specific architectural constraints.
