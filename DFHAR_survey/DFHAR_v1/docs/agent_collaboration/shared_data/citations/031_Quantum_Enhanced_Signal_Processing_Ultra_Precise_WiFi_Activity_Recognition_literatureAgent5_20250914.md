## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Quantum-Classical Hybrid Architecture**: The fundamental innovation lies in developing the first practical quantum-enhanced framework for WiFi signal processing, where quantum algorithms handle the most computationally intensive aspects of CSI analysis while classical systems manage real-time processing and integration tasks. The framework exploits quantum superposition and entanglement properties to process multiple signal hypotheses simultaneously, dramatically improving the sensitivity and precision of activity detection algorithms.

**Quantum Fourier Transform for CSI Analysis**: The core algorithmic contribution employs quantum Fourier transform (QFT) algorithms specifically adapted for CSI spectral analysis, enabling exponentially faster frequency domain processing and enhanced resolution of subtle signal variations. The quantum implementation provides quadratic speedup for Fourier analysis while simultaneously accessing superposition states that reveal hidden patterns in wireless channel responses:
