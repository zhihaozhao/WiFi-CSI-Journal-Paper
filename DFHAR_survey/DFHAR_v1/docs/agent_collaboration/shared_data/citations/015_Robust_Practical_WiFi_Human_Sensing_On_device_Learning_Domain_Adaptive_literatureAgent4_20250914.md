## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system leverages Channel State Information (CSI) from MIMO-OFDM WiFi packets with a sophisticated mathematical foundation:

**CSI Measurement Matrix**:
```
X(t) = [x₁,₁(t),...x₁,ₖ,x₂,₁,...,xₘ,ₖ(t)]ᵀ = a(θ,τ)s(t) + N(t)
```

**Phase Shift Vector**:
```
a(θ,τ) = [1...Ω^(K-1)(τ),Φ(θ),...,Ω^(K-1)(τ)Φ(θ),...,Φ^(M-1)(θ),...,Ω^(K-1)Φ^(M-1)(θ)]
```

Where M = number of antennas, K = frequency subcarriers, s(t) = received signal vector, N(t) = noise vector.

**Channel Variation Factor**:
```
v = √(var(X)) / (1/T ∑ᵢ₌₁ᵀ |xᵢ|²)
```

### Algorithmic Contributions

**1. Pseudo Super-Resolution Algorithm**: Computationally efficient alternative to exhaustive MUSIC-based multipath resolution:
- Eigenvalue decomposition on covariance matrix across three dimensions (time, space, frequency)
- Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi method for sparse matrices
- 8× runtime performance improvement over MUSIC baseline

**2. Domain Adaptation Framework**: Transfer learning approach combining:
- Generalized baseline model from multi-house dataset
- On-device incremental learning with minimal user annotation
- User-in-the-loop self-tuning with change point detection

**3. Change Point Detection Algorithm**: Bottom-up segmentation technique:
```
G(i-1) = c(y_{i-1:i+1}) - [c(y_{i-1:i}) + c(y_{i:i+1})]
c(y_{i=m:n}) = √(∑ᵢ₌ₘⁿ (yᵢ - ȳ)² × (n-m))
```
