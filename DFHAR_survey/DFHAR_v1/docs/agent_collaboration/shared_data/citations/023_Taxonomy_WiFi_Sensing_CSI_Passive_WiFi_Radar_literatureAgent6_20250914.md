- Subcarrier-level granular analysis providing fine-grained features
- Optimal performance in Line-of-Sight (LoS) configurations

**PWR System Characteristics**:
- Radar-based signal processing treating WiFi as illuminator of opportunity
- Cross Ambiguity Function (CAF) processing for range-Doppler extraction
- No knowledge of transmitted signal structure or content
- Entire signal utilization including preamble, data, and time gaps
- Superior performance in bistatic and monostatic configurations

#### 2. Advanced Signal Processing Methodologies

**CSI Processing Pipeline Innovation**:
The research presents a sophisticated three-stage processing framework:

**Stage 1: Advanced Denoising**
```
DWT-based filtering → Median filtering → Noise reduction
```
- Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for high-frequency component preservation
- Adaptive threshold computation for multi-level noise removal
- 1-D median filtering for transient suppression

**Stage 2: Intelligent Dimension Reduction**
```
Raw CSI (90k samples/sec) → PCA → 5 components → 90% complexity reduction
```
- Principal Component Analysis extracting 5 components from 90 subcarrier-antenna combinations
- Strategic first component elimination to remove stationary reflection effects
- Optimal trade-off between classification performance and computational complexity

**Stage 3: Spectrogram Generation**
```
STFT: X(t,k) = Σ(n=-∞ to ∞) x[n]w[n-t]e^(-jkn)
```
- Short-Time Fourier Transform with Hamming windowing
- Time-frequency-amplitude three-dimensional representation
- Averaged spectrogram generation from multiple principal components

**PWR Processing Innovation**:
The research implements a sophisticated three-stage PWR processing pipeline:

**Stage 1: Cross Ambiguity Function**
```
CAF(τ,fd) = ∫[0 to Ti] x(t)y*(t-τ)e^(j2πfdt)dt
```
- Low-complexity CAF implementation for real-time processing
- Batch processing architecture dividing long sequences for computational efficiency
- Range-Doppler surface generation with adjustable resolution parameters

**Stage 2: Advanced Interference Mitigation**

- CSI optimal performance: 90% accuracy
- PWR suboptimal due to minimal relative velocity

**Layout 2: Bistatic Configuration**

Data Samples: 1,122 total samples
Environment: 3m × 3m monitoring area
Positions: 9 testing positions (1.5m separation)
Window Length: 4-second sliding window analysis
```

#### 4. Advanced Mathematical Signal Modeling

**OFDM Signal Representation**:
```
Transmitted: x(t) = (1/√N) Σ(n=1 to N) ane^(j2π(n/Ts)t)
Received: y(t) = Σp Ape^(j2πfdt)x(t-τ) + n(t)
```

**Channel State Information Calculation**:
```
H(fc,t) = Y(fc,t)/X(fc,t)
```
where fc represents carrier frequency and t denotes time variation due to human movement.

**Doppler Effect Mathematical Framework**:
Both systems exploit Doppler frequency shifts caused by human movement:
- High frequencies: Fast torso movements
