## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system integrates dynamic power management with intelligent duty cycling for energy-efficient WiFi sensing while maintaining activity recognition performance:

**Dynamic Power Consumption Model**:
```
P_total(t) = P_rf(t) + P_proc(t) + P_idle(t)
P_rf(t) = α × f_sample(t) + β × BW(t) + γ × TX_power(t)
```
Where α, β, γ are hardware-specific coefficients and control variables adapt to sensing requirements.

**Intelligent Duty Cycling Algorithm**:
```
δ_optimal = arg min Σ_t [P_total(t) × δ(t)]
subject to: R_accuracy ≥ R_target, L_latency ≤ L_max
```
Optimizing duty cycle δ(t) balancing power consumption with performance constraints.

**Predictive Activity-Aware Scheduling**:
```
S(t+Δt) = LSTM(S(t-w:t), C(t), P_history)
Power_budget(t+Δt) = f_allocation(S(t+Δt), E_remaining(t))
```
Using LSTM prediction to adaptively allocate power budget based on predicted activity patterns.

### Algorithmic Contributions

}
```
