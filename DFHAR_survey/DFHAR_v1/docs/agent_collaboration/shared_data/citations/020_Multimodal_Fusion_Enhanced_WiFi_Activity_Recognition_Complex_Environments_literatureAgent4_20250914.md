## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system integrates multiple sensing modalities through advanced fusion architectures with WiFi CSI as the primary channel, enhanced by complementary sensor streams:

**Multi-Modal Fusion Tensor**:
```
F(t) = W_wifi ⊗ X_wifi(t) + W_audio ⊗ X_audio(t) + W_motion ⊗ X_motion(t)
```
Where ⊗ represents tensor product fusion and W_i are learned modality-specific weight tensors.

**Attention-Weighted Cross-Modal Correlation**:
```
α_ij = softmax(Q_i^T K_j / √d_k)
C_fused = Σ_i Σ_j α_ij × V_i ⊗ V_j
```
Computing cross-attention between modalities i and j with query Q, key K, and value V matrices.

**Temporal Coherence Constraint**:
```
L_temporal = Σ_t ||F(t) - F(t-1)||_2^2 + λ ||∇_t F(t)||_1
```
Enforcing smooth temporal transitions with L2 continuity and L1 sparsity regularization.

### Algorithmic Contributions

**1. Hierarchical Multi-Modal Attention (HMMA)**: Three-tier attention mechanism processing:
- **Intra-modal attention**: Features within each modality (WiFi, audio, IMU)
- **Inter-modal attention**: Cross-modality feature correlation and dependency modeling
- **Temporal attention**: Long-range temporal dependency capture across time steps

**2. Adaptive Fusion Weight Learning**: Dynamic modality importance adaptation based on environmental context:
```
w_i(t) = σ(MLP_fusion([ρ_i(t), SNR_i(t), Activity_context(t)]))
```
Where ρ_i represents modality reliability, SNR_i signal quality, and Activity_context semantic information.

**3. Complex Environment Robustness Algorithm**: Multi-level noise handling and interference mitigation:
- **Spatial filtering**: Beamforming-based interference suppression for WiFi channels
- **Spectral cleaning**: Adaptive filtering for audio channel environmental noise
- **Motion artifact removal**: Kalman filtering for IMU sensor drift and bias correction
