## Algorithmic Innovation Assessment

### Core Algorithmic Contributions

#### 1. Dynamic Sub-carrier Compression Algorithm
**Innovation Level**: High - Novel attention-based approach for CSI dimensionality reduction
**Technical Details**:
- **Attention Mechanism**: Modified from SENet, applies channel-wise attention along sub-carrier dimension
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  W = Sigmoid(ReLU(FC(MEAN(D, 2)))) · ones(1,T)
  D' = W ⊙ D
  ```
- **Compression Process**: Merges neighboring sub-carriers through weighted accumulation:
  ```
  D''(i, :) = Σ(k=(i-1)*n+1 to i*n) D'(k, :)
  ```

**Algorithmic Novelty**:
- First dynamic sub-carrier selection approach that considers label relationships
- Eliminates empirical threshold dependency of traditional methods
- Reduces input dimension from C to C/n while preserving discriminative information

- **FLOPs Reduction**: 30% reduction (27.4M → 19.3M FLOPs)
- **Accuracy Maintenance**: Minimal 3% accuracy loss with significant complexity reduction

#### 3. Dual-task Learning Framework
**Innovation Level**: High - First end-to-end dual-task approach for WiFi sensing
**Technical Architecture**:
- **Shared Backbone**: Feature extraction through multi-scale convolutional layers
- **Channel Split Strategy**: Feature maps split into detection and recognition branches
- **Joint Loss Function**: Combined regression and classification losses
  ```
  L = L1 + λL2
  where L1 = (xs_p - xs_g)² + (xe_p - xe_g)²
        L2 = (1/N)Σj[-yjln(pj) + (1-yj)ln(1-pj)]
  ```

**Technical Advantages**:
- Simultaneous detection and recognition without sequential dependency
- Shared feature learning improves both tasks through mutual reinforcement
- End-to-end optimization eliminates manual threshold tuning
