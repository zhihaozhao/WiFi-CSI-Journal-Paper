## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system leverages quantum computing principles to enhance WiFi Channel State Information processing through quantum-enhanced signal processing algorithms:

**Quantum CSI State Representation**:
```
|ψ_CSI⟩ = Σ_i α_i |φ_i⟩ ⊗ |χ_i⟩
```
Where |φ_i⟩ represents amplitude states and |χ_i⟩ represents phase states in quantum superposition.

**Quantum Fourier Transform for CSI Analysis**:
```
QFT|x⟩ = (1/√2^n) Σ_{y=0}^{2^n-1} ω_2^n^{xy} |y⟩
```
Where ω_2^n = e^{2πi/2^n} provides exponential speedup for frequency domain analysis.

**Quantum Variational Algorithm for Feature Extraction**:
```
E(θ) = ⟨ψ(θ)|H|ψ(θ)⟩ = Σ_i c_i ⟨ψ(θ)|P_i|ψ(θ)⟩
```
Where H is the Hamiltonian encoding CSI patterns and P_i are Pauli measurements.
