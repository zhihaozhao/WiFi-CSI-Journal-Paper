## Executive Summary

This paper presents Slim-Sense, a groundbreaking resource-efficient WiFi sensing framework that addresses the critical challenge of bandwidth resource optimization in Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. The work introduces a novel dual-component approach combining Sparse Group Regularizer (SGR) with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) to achieve remarkable resource savings of up to 92.9% while maintaining sensing accuracy within 5% degradation. This represents a paradigm shift toward practical ISAC deployment where sensing and communication functions must coexist efficiently.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Sparse Group Regularizer (SGR) Framework**: The fundamental innovation lies in the mathematically rigorous sparse group regularization approach that simultaneously considers both inter-group and intra-group sparsity constraints for optimal subcarrier selection in OFDM-based sensing systems. Unlike conventional approaches that treat resource allocation as a binary optimization problem, SGR introduces a sophisticated penalty framework that naturally balances sensing performance with resource consumption through carefully designed regularization terms.

**Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Integration**: The integration of HRL provides adaptive decision-making capabilities that enable the system to learn optimal resource allocation strategies across diverse environmental conditions and sensing requirements. This two-level hierarchical structure separates high-level sensing objectives from low-level resource allocation decisions, creating a scalable framework that adapts to changing operational conditions without requiring extensive retraining.

### Mathematical Framework and Optimization

**Multi-Objective Optimization Formulation**: The paper establishes a comprehensive mathematical framework that formulates the resource-sensing trade-off as a constrained optimization problem incorporating both sensing accuracy constraints and communication bandwidth limitations. The objective function elegantly balances multiple competing objectives including sensing performance, resource utilization, and cross-domain generalization capability through weighted penalty terms.

**Convergence Analysis and Theoretical Guarantees**: Rigorous theoretical analysis provides convergence guarantees for the proposed SGR-HRL framework, establishing conditions under which the algorithm converges to optimal or near-optimal solutions. The convergence analysis considers both the sparse regularization optimization and the reinforcement learning policy convergence, providing comprehensive theoretical foundations for the practical implementation.

## System Architecture and Engineering Design

### ISAC Integration Framework

**Sensing-Communication Co-Design**: The architecture fundamentally reimagines ISAC system design by treating sensing and communication as cooperative rather than competing functions. The framework develops novel signal processing techniques that enable simultaneous sensing and communication operations while optimizing resource allocation dynamically based on application requirements and network conditions.

**Cross-Layer Optimization**: The system implements sophisticated cross-layer optimization mechanisms that coordinate resource allocation decisions across physical, MAC, and application layers. This holistic approach ensures that resource optimization decisions consider the full system impact rather than optimizing individual components in isolation.

### Adaptive Resource Management

**Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation**: The framework introduces intelligent bandwidth allocation mechanisms that adapt resource distribution based on real-time sensing requirements and communication demands. The system monitors sensing performance continuously and adjusts resource allocation to maintain target performance levels while minimizing resource consumption.
