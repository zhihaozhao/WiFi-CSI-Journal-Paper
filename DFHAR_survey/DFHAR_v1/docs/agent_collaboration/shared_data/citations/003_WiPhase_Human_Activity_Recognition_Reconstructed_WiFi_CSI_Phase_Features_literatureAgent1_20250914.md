The work tackles the critical problem that most existing models ignore sub-carrier correlations and rely on inefficient deeper networks for performance improvement. WiPhase achieves breakthrough performance with 98.75% accuracy while maintaining exceptional cross-domain generalization capability (90.57% under combined cross-domain conditions), representing a 40.34% reduction in training time and 46.74% reduction in computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This represents the first comprehensive approach to systematically exploit CSI sub-carrier correlations through reconstructed phase features, establishing new paradigms for efficient and robust WiFi sensing systems.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Revolutionary Architecture and Methodological Innovation

**Two-Stream Fusion Framework**: WiPhase introduces a groundbreaking dual-pathway architecture that separately extracts temporal features and sub-carrier correlation features from reconstructed CSI phase data. This represents a fundamental departure from existing single-stream approaches that inadequately capture the complex relationships between WiFi sub-carriers. The system combines a Gated Pseudo-Siamese Network (GPSiam) for temporal feature extraction with a Dynamic Resolution-based Graph Attention Network (DRGAT) for sub-carrier correlation analysis.

**Mathematical Framework for Phase Reconstruction**: The core innovation lies in CSI Phase Integration Representation (CSI-PIR) construction, which mathematically combines phase difference and phase ratio between adjacent receiving antennas:

```
CSI-PIR: c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,pir = pr^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s · e^(-jΔ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,m)    (13)

Phase Ratio: pr^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s = e^(-j∠c^(ntnr+1)_s,t) / e^(-j∠c^(ntnr)_s,t)    (12)

Phase Difference: Δ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,m = Δ∠c^(nt,nr,nr+1)_s,t + ΔP_dll + ΔE    (10)
```

This reconstruction eliminates time-varying random phase offsets while preserving activity-related phase information, making CSI-PIR more robust and relevant to human activity changes compared to raw CSI amplitude, phase, or traditional CSI representations.

**Advanced Signal Processing Pipeline**: The system implements sophisticated preprocessing through Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) for activity-related CSI separation and Sparse Signal Representation (SSP) for optimal sub-carrier selection. EEMD adaptively decomposes signals into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs):

```
c^(ntnr)_s(t) = Σ(n=1 to N) imf_n(t) + r_N(t)    (7)
```

SSP extracts 10 most relevant sub-carriers from 30 original sub-carriers based on phase variance analysis, achieving 3× dimensionality reduction while improving signal-to-noise ratio.

### Gated Pseudo-Siamese Network Innovation

**Temporal Feature Extraction with Causal Constraints**: GPSiam addresses fundamental limitations of RNN-based approaches through right-aligned causal convolution that preserves temporal causality while enabling parallel processing. The network ensures current estimates cannot depend on future inputs: e(h^t|h^1, h^2, ..., h^(t-1)) while achieving O(T) complexity compared to O(T^2) for transformers and O(Th + h^2) for LSTMs.

**Gated Attention Mechanism**: The system combines global max pooling, global average pooling, and gated units with hyperbolic tangent and sigmoid activation functions, implementing quasi-attention mechanisms that can directly assign zero values to unimportant features:

```
Training Objective: L = L_pd + L_pr + L_s
L_pd = -ω_pd Σ_a y^a_pd log(f_pd(h^a_pd; θ_pd))
L_pr = -ω_pr Σ_a y^a_pr log(f_pr(h^a_pr; θ_pr))
L_s = -ω_s Σ_a y^a_s log(f_s(o^a_pd, o^a_pr; θ_pd, θ_pr))    (14)
```

### Dynamic Resolution Graph Attention Network

**Sub-carrier Correlation Modeling**: DRGAT represents the first systematic approach to model CSI sub-carrier correlations through graph neural networks. The CSI phase graph construction utilizes Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm for edge computation, providing more accurate similarity assessment than Euclidean distance-based methods.

**Dynamic Resolution Architecture**: The multi-resolution approach (R₁ ≤ R₂ ≤ R₃ where 500 ≤ R₁ ≤ R₂ ≤ R₃ ≤ 1000) enables efficient processing by routing samples to appropriate resolution levels, reducing computational complexity while maintaining recognition accuracy for difficult samples.

**Graph Attention Mathematical Framework**: Multi-head attention mechanism for sub-carrier correlation extraction:

```
g'_r = ‖^Q_(q=1) σ(Σ_(γ∈N_r) α^q_rγ W^q g_γ)    (17)
α_rγ = softmax(e_rγ) = exp(e_rγ) / Σ_(μ∈N_r) exp(e_rμ)    (19)
e_rγ = LeakyReLU(W^f ‖[Wg_r‖Wg_γ])    (20)
```

### Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis
