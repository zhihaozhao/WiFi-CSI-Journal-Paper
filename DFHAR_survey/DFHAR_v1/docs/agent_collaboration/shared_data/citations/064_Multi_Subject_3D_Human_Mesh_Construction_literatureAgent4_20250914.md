## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Contribution

MultiMesh represents a significant advancement in WiFi-based sensing by extending 3D human mesh construction from single-subject to multi-subject scenarios using commodity WiFi devices. The system addresses three fundamental challenges: subject separation, indirect reflection interference, and the near-far problem.

### Key Technical Innovations

1. **Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing**:
   - **2D Angle of Arrival (AoA)**: Uses L-shaped antenna array to estimate azimuth and elevation angles
   - **Angle of Departure (AoD)**: Incorporates transmitter-side spatial information
   - **Time of Flight (ToF)**: Leverages OFDM subcarrier frequency differences
   - **Joint 4D Estimation**: Combines azimuth, elevation, AoD, and ToF for enhanced resolvability

2. **Advanced Subject Separation Framework**:
   ```
   Resolvability Enhancement:
   - Azimuth-Elevation only: 50% separation at 50cm distance
   - + AoD: 50% separation at 30cm distance
   - + ToF: 50% separation at 20cm distance
   ```

3. **Indirect Reflection Mitigation**:
   - **Path Length Analysis**: Distinguishes direct vs. indirect reflections using ToF differences
   - **Angular Discrimination**: Leverages different AoD characteristics of indirect reflections
   - **YOLACT-based Detection**: Deep learning instance segmentation for signal source identification

4. **Near-Far Problem Solution**:
   - **DeepSORT Tracking**: Appearance and motion branch tracking for weak signal continuity
   - **Temporal Coherence**: Exploits human movement predictability vs. random noise patterns
   - **Kalman Filter Integration**: Predicts and tracks subject trajectories over time

### Mathematical Framework

#### 4D Spatial Spectrum Estimation
```
P(θ,φ,ω,τ) = 1 / (A^H(θ,φ,ω,τ)E_N E_N^H A(θ,φ,ω,τ))
```

#### Multi-Scale Signal Processing
- **Azimuth Phase Shift**: Φ_x(φ_l,θ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ sin(φ_l)cos(θ_l))
- **Elevation Phase Shift**: Φ_z(φ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ cos(φ_l))
- **AoD Phase Shift**: Ψ(ω) = e^(-j2πfd sin(ω)/c)
- **ToF Phase Shift**: Ω(τ) = e^(-j2πf_δτ_l/c)
