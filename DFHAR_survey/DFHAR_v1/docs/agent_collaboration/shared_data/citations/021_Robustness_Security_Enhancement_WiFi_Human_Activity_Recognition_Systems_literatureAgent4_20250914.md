## Mathematical Framework and Technical Innovation

### Core Mathematical Model
The system integrates comprehensive security and robustness mechanisms for WiFi sensing systems through advanced adversarial defense and attack detection algorithms:

**Adversarial Perturbation Detection Model**:
```
δ_adv = arg min ||δ||_p subject to f(x + δ) ≠ f(x)
Detection: D(x) = ||x - P_clean(x)||_2 > τ_threshold
```
Where P_clean represents clean signal projection and τ_threshold is adaptive detection threshold.

**Robust Feature Extraction Framework**:
```
F_robust = Encoder(X_csi) → BN(ReLU(Conv1D(X_filtered)))
X_filtered = MedianFilter(GaussianFilter(X_csi, σ_adaptive))
```
Multi-level filtering combined with batch normalization for adversarial robustness.

**Trust Score Computation**:
```
Trust(x_t) = Σ_i w_i × Consistency(f_i(x_t), f_ensemble(x_t))
w_i = softmax(Historical_performance_i / Temperature)
```
Weighted ensemble trust scoring based on model consistency and historical reliability.
