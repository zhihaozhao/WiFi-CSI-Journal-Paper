## Executive Summary

This groundbreaking research addresses two fundamental challenges that have limited the practical deployment of WiFi-based Human Activity Recognition (HAR) systems: imbalanced training datasets and changing environmental circumstances. The authors introduce Class Region Flattening (CRF), a novel methodology that seeks class-conditional flat minima to enhance generalization capabilities across diverse deployment scenarios. The work demonstrates that existing WiFi-based HAR models often converge to sharp minima when trained on long-tailed distributions, significantly reducing their cross-domain performance. Through comprehensive experimental validation on six distinct indoor environments with varying imbalance ratios, the proposed CRF and CRF-S (selective flattening) methods achieve substantial improvements, with up to 9.25% accuracy gains for TOSS, 1.65% for DANN, and 1.24% for CNN models.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Core Methodological Contribution

**Unified Approach to Dual Challenges**: The fundamental innovation lies in recognizing that both imbalanced data distribution and domain adaptation challenges can be addressed through a unified geometric optimization perspective. Rather than treating these as separate problems, the authors establish that both issues manifest as sharp minima in the parameter space, leading to poor generalization across activity categories and environmental conditions. This insight enables a single mathematical framework to simultaneously address data imbalance and domain shift.

**Class Region Flattening (CRF) Framework**: The core algorithmic contribution introduces category-specific parameter perturbation mechanisms that seek flat minima for each activity class independently. Unlike traditional approaches that apply uniform optimization strategies, CRF recognizes that different activity classes exhibit varying loss landscapes, particularly in imbalanced scenarios where tail classes suffer from insufficient training samples. The method implements class-conditional perturbations using the mathematical formulation:

```
L_flat(w_tmp) = Σ(c=1 to k) L^c_flat(w_tmp)
L^c_flat(w_tmp) = max(||ε_c||_2≤ρ_c) L^c_erm(w_tmp + ε_c) ≈ L^c_erm(w^c_tmp)
ε*_c = η * ρ_c * (∇_w_tmp L^c_erm(w_tmp))/(||∇_w_tmp L^c_erm(w_tmp)||_2)
```

**Selective Flattening Strategy (CRF-S)**: To address computational overhead and gradient conflicts inherent in class-based optimization, the authors introduce CRF-S, which employs similarity-based gradient selection. This innovation calculates cosine similarity between class-specific gradients and the average gradient, selecting the most aligned gradients for perturbation. This approach reduces optimization conflicts while maintaining computational efficiency, achieving superior performance improvements of approximately 2% across all baseline models.

### System Architecture and Engineering Design

**Theoretical Foundation Integration**: The framework leverages Perturbative PAC-Bayesian Generalization Theory to provide mathematical rigor for the flat minima search process. The authors extend beyond empirical observations to establish theoretical guarantees for generalization improvement, deriving that the perturbation direction aligning with the first-order derivative maximizes the generalization bound. This theoretical grounding distinguishes CRF from purely empirical approaches.

**Multi-Model Compatibility**: The system design ensures seamless integration with existing WiFi-based HAR architectures, including CNN, DANN, and TOSS models. The perturbation mechanism operates as a training augmentation rather than architectural modification, enabling broad applicability across different neural network designs. The framework maintains compatibility with various baseline training methodologies while providing consistent performance improvements.

**Adaptive Parameter Management**: The system implements sophisticated hyperparameter adaptation mechanisms, including dynamic perturbation radius selection (ρ) and gradient selection thresholds (κ_t). The experimental analysis reveals optimal parameter ranges: ρ = 3.0 × 10^-6, α = 0.4, and κ_t = 2 for four-class scenarios, with adaptive mechanisms for different problem scales.

## Mathematical Framework Analysis

### Loss Landscape Geometric Analysis

**Sharp vs. Flat Minima Characterization**: The authors provide comprehensive 1D and 2D loss landscape visualizations demonstrating that conventional WiFi-based HAR models converge to sharp minima, particularly for tail classes in imbalanced scenarios. The mathematical analysis reveals that sharp minima correspond to poor generalization, with loss values increasing rapidly under parameter perturbations. The empirical analysis shows that TOSS and MetaSense exhibit sharper curves compared to CNN baselines, motivating the flattening approach.

**Class-Conditional Optimization Theory**: The mathematical framework extends Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) principles to class-conditional scenarios through the formulation:

```
L_overall = L_erm(w_tmp) + α * L_flat(w_tmp)
```

where the flattening loss L_flat aggregates class-specific perturbations. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach enables discovery of minima that are simultaneously flat across all activity categories, addressing the fundamental challenge of imbalanced learning in WiFi sensing scenarios.

**First-Order Taylor Approximation Validation**: The authors provide rigorous mathematical analysis validating the use of first-order Taylor expansion for perturbation calculation. The error analysis demonstrates that second-order terms contribute negligibly (|R_2| ≤ 5 × 10^-15) given the perturbation magnitudes, justifying the computational efficiency of first-order approximations while maintaining optimization accuracy.

### Convergence and Optimization Guarantees

**Gradient Conflict Resolution**: The mathematical framework addresses gradient conflicts through similarity-based selection mechanisms. The analysis reveals that randomly selecting class-specific gradients can lead to divergent optimization directions, particularly when gradients exhibit significant angular deviations. The CRF-S approach mitigates this through:

```
Sim(g^c, ḡ) = (g^c * ḡ)/(||g^c * ḡ||)
ḡ = (1/k)Σ(c=1 to k)g^c, g^c = ∇_w_tmp L^c(w_tmp)
```

**Computational Complexity Analysis**: The framework provides detailed computational complexity analysis, demonstrating that CRF requires multiple forward and backward propagations per class, while CRF-S reduces this overhead through selective updates. The time complexity analysis shows average reductions of 1.24% for CNN, 1.9% for DANN, and 2.12% for TOSS models while achieving superior performance improvements.

## Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### Comprehensive Multi-Environment Evaluation

**Cross-Domain Robustness Assessment**: The experimental validation encompasses 13 sets of 1-on-1 domain adaptation experiments across six diverse indoor environments (building entrance, corridor, hall, laboratory, meeting room, open platform). The results demonstrate consistent improvements across varying environmental conditions, with CRF-S achieving average accuracy increases of 3.5% for CNN, 3.55% for DANN, and 11.37% for TOSS models compared to baseline methods.

**Imbalance Ratio Scalability**: The framework demonstrates robust performance across varying imbalance ratios (10, 50, 100), with consistent improvements maintained even under extreme imbalance conditions. The experimental analysis reveals that TOSS models benefit most significantly from the flattening approach (15% improvement at ratio 100), while CNN and DANN models show more modest but consistent gains (5-6% improvement).

**Multi-Source and Multi-Target Validation**: The comprehensive evaluation includes multi-source domain adaptation (environments E3-E6 to E1) and multi-target scenarios (E1 to E3-E6), demonstrating generalizability beyond simple pairwise domain transfer. The results show improvements of 4.34% for DANN in multi-source scenarios and 3.74% for TOSS in multi-target configurations.

### Statistical Analysis and Visualization

**Loss Landscape Visualization**: The 2D loss landscape analysis provides compelling visual evidence of the flattening effect, particularly for tail classes. The visualizations demonstrate that conventional methods result in steep loss surfaces for underrepresented activities, while CRF-S produces more uniform flat regions across all categories. This visual evidence supports the theoretical framework and explains the improved generalization performance.

**Ablation Study Insights**: The comprehensive ablation studies reveal that perturbation direction contributes more significantly than perturbation magnitude to performance improvements. The analysis demonstrates that both CRF and CRF-S benefit from each component, with selective flattening providing the most substantial contribution to optimization stability and performance enhancement.

## Critical Assessment and Limitations

### Technical Constraints and Challenges

**Computational Overhead Considerations**: While CRF-S reduces computational overhead compared to CRF, the method still requires dual gradient computations for parameter perturbation and updates. The training time analysis reveals 15-20% increases in computational cost across different baseline models, which may limit deployment in resource-constrained environments.

**Hyperparameter Sensitivity**: The framework requires careful tuning of multiple hyperparameters (ρ, α, κ_t), with performance showing sensitivity to these parameters. While the authors provide empirical guidance for parameter selection, optimal values may require environment-specific tuning for peak performance.

**Limited Activity Complexity**: The evaluation focuses primarily on basic activities (walking, jumping, turning, sitting/standing) within controlled indoor environments. The generalizability to more complex activity patterns, outdoor scenarios, or highly dynamic environments requires additional validation.

### Methodological Considerations

**Gradient Selection Strategy Limitations**: The similarity-based gradient selection in CRF-S, while effective, relies on cosine similarity measures that may not capture all aspects of gradient compatibility. The authors acknowledge that adaptive selection strategies could further improve stability and performance.

**Environmental Diversity Constraints**: While the evaluation encompasses six diverse indoor environments, the framework's performance in scenarios with extreme electromagnetic interference, highly reflective surfaces, or non-stationary environmental conditions requires further investigation.
