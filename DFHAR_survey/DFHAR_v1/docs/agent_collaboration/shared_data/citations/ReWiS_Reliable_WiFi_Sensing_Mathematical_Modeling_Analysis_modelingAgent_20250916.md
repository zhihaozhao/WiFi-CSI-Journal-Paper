## 1. Few-Shot Learning Mathematical Framework

### 1.1 Prototypical Networks Mathematical Formulation

The ReWiS framework employs **Prototypical Networks (ProtoNet)** as its core FSL engine, providing mathematically elegant solutions to the few-shot classification problem.

#### Problem Formulation
Given a training task $T_e = \{D_1, \ldots, D_K\}$ where each class set is defined as:
```
D_k = {(x_i, y_i) | y_i = k}, k ∈ {1, ..., K}
```

The task is divided into support and query sets:
- **Support set**: $S_e = \{(s_1, y_1), \ldots, (s_N, y_1), \ldots, (s_N, y_K)\}$
- **Query set**: $Q_e = \{(q_1, y_1), \ldots, (q_L, y_1), \ldots, (q_L, y_K)\}$

#### Class Prototype Computation
The fundamental mathematical innovation lies in computing class prototypes as the mean of embedded support samples:

$$p_k = \frac{1}{|D_k|} \sum_{(s_i, y_k) \in D_k} f_\theta(s_i)$$

where $f_\theta: \mathbb{R}^d \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ is the embedding function with learnable parameters $\theta$.

#### Distance-Based Classification
Classification uses **softmax over Euclidean distances** in the embedding space:

$$L(Q_e) = -\frac{1}{|Q_e|} \sum_{(q_i, y_i) \in Q_e} \log \frac{\exp(-\|f_\theta(q_i) - p_k\|^2)}{\sum_{k'} \exp(-\|f_\theta(q_i) - p_{k'}\|^2)}$$

**Mathematical Significance**: This formulation provides:
- **Inductive bias**: Class prototypes naturally cluster similar examples
- **Generalization bounds**: Euclidean distance provides metric learning guarantees
- **Computational efficiency**: O(K) prototype computations vs. O(N·K) pairwise comparisons

### 1.2 Embedding Function Learning

The embedding function $f_\theta$ is optimized through cross-entropy loss minimization:

$$\theta^* = \arg\min_\theta L_{ce}(S; \theta)$$

where $S = \bigcup\{S_1, \ldots, S_e, \ldots, S_E\}$ represents the merged support sets across all training episodes.

**Convergence Analysis**: The embedding learning follows standard SGD convergence with rate $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ for non-convex objectives, where $T$ is the number of training iterations.

### 1.3 Meta-Learning Optimization

The few-shot learning process implements **episodic training** with meta-learning objectives:
- **Inner loop**: Prototype computation for each task
- **Outer loop**: Embedding parameter updates across tasks

**Mathematical Guarantee**: Under Lipschitz embedding assumptions, the generalization error bounded by:
$$\mathcal{E}_{test} \leq \mathcal{E}_{train} + O\left(\sqrt{\frac{\log K}{N}}\right)$$

## 2. WiFi CSI Signal Processing Mathematical Models

### 2.1 CSI Matrix Representation

The mathematical foundation begins with MIMO-OFDM CSI matrix formulation:

$$H_r^{m,n} = \begin{bmatrix}
h_{1,1}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{1,s}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{1,S}^{m,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
h_{p,1}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{p,s}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{p,S}^{m,n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
h_{P,1}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{P,s}^{m,n} & \cdots & h_{P,S}^{m,n}
\end{bmatrix}$$

where:
- $h_{p,s}^{m,n}$ represents complex-valued CSI for packet $p$, subcarrier $s$, transmit antenna $m$, receive antenna $n$
- $P$ = number of packets, $S$ = number of subcarriers
- Matrix dimensions: $P \times S$ for each antenna pair

### 2.2 Data Frame Integration

Multi-antenna CSI integration through stacking operation:
$$H_r = [\hat{H}_r^{m,1}, \ldots, \hat{H}_r^{m,N}]^T$$

where $\hat{H}_r^{m,n}$ represents windowed CSI segments of dimension $W \times S$.

**Amplitude and Phase Decomposition**:
$$H_r = H_r^A e^{jH_r^\phi}$$
where:
- $H_r^A = \|H_r\|$ (amplitude matrix)
- $H_r^\phi = \angle H_r$ (phase matrix)

### 2.3 Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) Mathematical Framework

#### SVD Decomposition
The dimensionality reduction employs SVD factorization:
$$H_r^T = U\Sigma V^T$$

where:
- $U \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times S}$: left singular vectors
- $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times S}$: diagonal singular values matrix
- $V \in \mathbb{R}^{(N \cdot W) \times S}$: right singular vectors

#### Compact Representation
The reduced-dimension data frame:
$$H_r' = H_r^T \times V$$

**Dimensionality Reduction**: From $N \times W \times S$ to $S \times S$, achieving ~80% size reduction.

#### Mathematical Justification
SVD preserves the most significant signal subspace components by:
1. **Rank-revealing property**: Captures dominant channel characteristics
2. **Optimal approximation**: Minimizes Frobenius norm error
3. **Subcarrier correlation preservation**: Maintains frequency domain relationships

### 2.4 Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) Feature Extraction

Final feature representation through subcarrier correlation analysis:
$$\rho_{H}(i,j) = \frac{E[(H_i - \mu_{H_i})(H_j - \mu_{H_j})]}{\sigma_{H_i}\sigma_{H_j}}$$

**Matrix Form**: $\rho_H \in \mathbb{R}^{S \times S}$ correlation matrix serves as input to the learning module.

## 3. Multi-Diversity Mathematical Models

### 3.1 Spatial Diversity Framework

#### Micro-Diversity (Multi-Antenna)
**Mathematical Model**: Independent fading assumption across antennas
$$h_{i,j} = \alpha_{i,j} e^{j\phi_{i,j}}, \quad i,j \text{ independent}$$

**Diversity Gain**: For $N_a$ antennas, signal-to-noise ratio improvement:
$$\text{SNR}_{combined} = \sum_{i=1}^{N_a} \text{SNR}_i$$

#### Macro-Diversity (Multi-Receiver)
**Mathematical Model**: Large-scale fading decorrelation
$$h_{r_1,r_2} \text{ decorrelated for } d(r_1,r_2) > \lambda_c$$

where $\lambda_c$ is the coherence distance.

**Performance Improvement**: Experimental validation shows:
- Micro-diversity: +16% accuracy improvement
- Macro-diversity: +38% accuracy improvement

### 3.2 Time Diversity Mathematical Analysis

**Temporal Correlation Model**:
$$R_{HH}(\tau) = E[H(t)H^*(t-\tau)]$$

**Coherence Time**: $T_c = \frac{1}{2f_d}$ where $f_d$ is Doppler frequency

**Window Size Optimization**: Performance vs. delay trade-off analysis shows optimal window size $W = 300$ samples.

## 4. Reliability and Robustness Mathematical Analysis

### 4.1 Cross-Environment Adaptation Framework

#### Domain Shift Mathematical Model
Source domain $\mathcal{D}_S = \{X_S, P_S(X,Y)\}$ and target domain $\mathcal{D}_T = \{X_T, P_T(X,Y)\}$ with distribution shift.

#### Adaptation Bounds
**Theoretical Guarantee**: For domain adaptation error:
$$\epsilon_T \leq \epsilon_S + \frac{1}{2}d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{D}_S, \mathcal{D}_T) + \lambda^*$$

where:
- $d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}$ is the H-divergence between domains
- $\lambda^*$ is the ideal joint error

### 4.2 Noise Robustness Analysis

#### Signal-to-Noise Ratio Model
$$h_{p,s} = h_{p,s}^{clean} + n_{p,s}$$
where $n_{p,s} \sim \mathcal{CN}(0, \sigma_n^2)$

#### Robustness Bounds
Multi-diversity provides noise resilience through:
$$\text{SINR}_{effective} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} |h_i|^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sigma_{n_i}^2}$$

**Experimental Validation**: <10% accuracy drop in unseen environments vs. >45% for CNN baselines.
