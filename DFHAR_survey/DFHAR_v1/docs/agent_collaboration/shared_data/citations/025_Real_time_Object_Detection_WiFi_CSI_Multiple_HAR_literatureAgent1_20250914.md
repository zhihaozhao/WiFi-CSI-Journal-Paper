## Executive Summary

This paper addresses a critical limitation in WiFi CSI-based human activity recognition by proposing the first real-time object detection framework for multiple activity recognition using WiFi signals. Unlike traditional CSI-based models that rely on offline preprocessing and pre-segmentation, this work introduces a deep learning object detection framework using Mask R-CNN combined with continuous wavelet transform (CWT) to enable real-time recognition of multiple activities in streaming CSI data. The approach achieves 93.80% average classification accuracy and 90.73% instance segmentation accuracy, representing a significant advancement toward practical deployment of WiFi sensing systems in real-world environments where activities occur continuously and unpredictably.

## Technical Deep Dive

### Methodological Innovation and Real-time Processing

**Real-time Stream Processing Architecture**: The fundamental innovation lies in transforming the WiFi CSI activity recognition problem from offline batch processing to real-time streaming analysis. Traditional approaches require pre-segmented activity sequences processed offline, making them unsuitable for real-world deployment. This work introduces a sliding window approach that captures real-time CSI data streams and processes them continuously without prior knowledge of activity boundaries or durations.

**Mathematical Framework for Real-time CSI Processing**: The system models real-time data streams as infinite sequences S = <d₁, d₂, d₃, ...> where each dᵢ represents an n-dimensional vector (n = 30 subcarriers). The sliding window W containing k data items serves as baseline, with subsequent windows moving one time step with new stream data. The CSI signal between transmit-receive antenna pairs is expressed as:

```
y = Hx + n                                                    (1)
H = [h₁, h₂, ..., h_{Nsc}]                                   (2)
```

where H represents the channel matrix containing complex values with both amplitude and phase information for each subcarrier.

**Continuous Wavelet Transform Integration**: To address the fundamental challenge of tracking both temporal and frequency domain changes simultaneously, the framework employs continuous wavelet transform (CWT) defined as:

```
CWT(t,ω) = (ω/ω₀)^{1/2} ∫ s(t')Ψ*[ω/ω₀(t' - t)] dt'       (3)
```

This transformation enables time-frequency analysis that captures activity-specific patterns in both domains, essential for distinguishing between different activities occurring in temporal proximity.

### Advanced Object Detection Architecture

**Mask R-CNN Deep Learning Framework**: The system implements a sophisticated object detection network based on Mask R-CNN architecture, comprising feature extraction (ResNet-50 backbone), Region Proposal Network (RPN), RoIAlign, and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). The choice of object detection over traditional classification enables simultaneous activity classification, temporal localization, and instance segmentation within continuous streams.

**Bounding Box Regression Mathematics**: The bounding box regressor learns scale-invariant transformations between proposed boxes and ground truth boxes. For N training pairs (pᵢ, gᵢ), the transformation equations are:

```
ĝₓ = p_w d_x(p) + p_x,    ĝᵧ = p_h d_y(p) + p_y         (5)
ĝ_w = p_w exp(d_w(p)),    ĝ_h = p_h exp(d_h(p))
```

where the regression loss is minimized using:

```
L_{reg} = arg min_{ŵᵢ} Σᵢ (tᵢ - dᵢ(p))² + λ||ŵ||²        (7)
```

**Multi-component Loss Function**: The training objective combines three loss components to optimize classification, localization, and segmentation simultaneously:

```
L = L_{cls} + L_{bbox} + L_{mask}                          (8)
```

where L_{cls} represents cross-entropy classification loss, L_{bbox} handles bounding box regression loss, and L_{mask} provides binary cross-entropy loss for instance segmentation masks.

### Experimental Validation and Performance Analysis

### CSI-to-Image Transformation Innovation

**Time-Frequency Domain Image Generation**: The framework converts CSI time-series data into images using continuous wavelet transform, enabling application of computer vision techniques to wireless signal processing. This transformation preserves both temporal progression and frequency characteristics essential for activity discrimination.

**Frame Distance Measure Integration**: To address similarity and redundancy between consecutive frames from sliding windows, the system implements frame distance measures that reduce computational overhead while maintaining recognition accuracy. This optimization enables real-time processing without sacrificing performance quality.

**Power Profile Exploitation**: The system exploits power profiles from transformed images to provide insights for instance segmentation, enabling identification of unique human activities within continuous streams without pre-segmentation requirements.
