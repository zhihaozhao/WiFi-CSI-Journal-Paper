The survey establishes a solid mathematical foundation with:

**Core CSI Equation (Equation 1)**:
```
H(f_i,m,n,t) = |H(f_i,m,n,t)|e^(-j∠H(f_i,m,n,t))
= Σ(l=1 to L) A_l(f_i,m,n,t) × e^(-j2π d_l(t)/λ_i) × e^(-j2π (m-1)Δ_t cosψ_l(t)/λ_i) × e^(-j2π (n-1)Δ_r cosφ_l(t)/λ_i)
```

**Technical Evaluation**:
