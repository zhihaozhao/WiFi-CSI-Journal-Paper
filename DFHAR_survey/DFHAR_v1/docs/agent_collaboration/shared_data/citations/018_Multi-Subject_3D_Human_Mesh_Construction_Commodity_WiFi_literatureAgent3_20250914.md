## Executive Summary

This research introduces MultiMesh, a groundbreaking multi-subject 3D human mesh construction system based on commodity WiFi devices. The system represents a paradigm shift from single-subject to multi-subject scenarios in WiFi-based sensing, addressing critical limitations in existing approaches. MultiMesh leverages an L-shaped antenna array to generate two-dimensional angle of arrival (2D AoA) of reflected signals for subject separation in physical space, while incorporating angle of departure (AoD) and time of flight (ToF) to enhance resolvability for precise separation of close subjects. The system achieves remarkable performance with an average vertex error of 4cm for multiple users across diverse environments and occlusion scenarios, demonstrating substantial advancement over traditional computer vision-based approaches.

## Technical Innovation Analysis

### Multi-Dimensional Signal Processing Architecture

**Four-Dimensional Spatial Information Extraction**: The core innovation lies in jointly estimating four-dimensional information including azimuth, elevation, AoD, and ToF to significantly improve the resolvability of commodity WiFi sensing. The mathematical framework includes:

**2D AoA Estimation**: The system forms an L-shaped antenna array to extract spatial information:
```
Φ_x(φ_l, θ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ sin(φ_l) cos(θ_l))
Φ_z(φ_l) = e^(-j2πd/λ cos(φ_l))
```

where Φ_x and Φ_z represent phase differences between subarrays across X and Z axes respectively.

**AoD Integration**: Multiple transmitting antennas generate angle of departure information:
```
Ψ(ω) = e^(-j2πfd sin(ω)/c)
```

**ToF Enhancement**: OFDM subcarriers provide time-of-flight information:
```
Ω(τ) = e^(-j2πf_δτ_l/c)
```

**Joint 4D Estimation**: The unified spatial spectrum function maximizes multi-dimensional information:
```
P(θ,φ,ω,τ) = 1/(A^H(θ,φ,ω,τ)E_N E_N^H A(θ,φ,ω,τ))
```

### Advanced Subject Separation Techniques

**Multi-Subject Resolution Enhancement**: The system dramatically improves resolvability through multi-dimensional information fusion. Simulation results demonstrate that incorporating AoD and ToF reduces inseparability probability by factors of 2.2 and 10 respectively for subjects separated by 60cm.

**Indirect Reflection Mitigation**: Sophisticated algorithms distinguish direct from indirect reflections using propagation path analysis. The system leverages the insight that indirect reflections have longer propagation paths and different angles compared to direct reflections.

**Near-Far Problem Solution**: Dynamic tracking algorithms utilize motion coherence to distinguish weak signals from faraway subjects against noise, employing DeepSORT framework with appearance and motion branches.

### Deep Learning Mesh Construction Framework

**Multi-Regional Body Analysis**: The framework divides the human body into five regions (torso, left arm, right arm, left leg, right leg) for specialized deformation learning:

**CNN-GRU-Attention Architecture**:
- CNN extracts spatial features from 2D AoA images
- GRU captures temporal dependencies across consecutive frames
- Self-attention mechanism weights important frames dynamically
- SMPL model generates final 3D mesh with realistic human representation

**Loss Function Optimization**:
```
L_SMPL = λ_J L_p + λ_V L_s
Loss = (1/F) Σ ||K - GT(K)||_L1
```

## Mathematical Framework & Algorithmic Contributions

### Comprehensive Data Calibration

**Phase Offset Correction**: Optimal linear fit method removes random phase offsets:
```
σ = argmin_α Σ(Ψ(x,y,z) + 2πf_δ(z-1)α + β)²
```

**Static Reflection Subtraction**: Weighted frame subtraction eliminates static environment interference:
```
F_r = F_c - a₁F₁ - a₂F₂ - ... - a_nF_n
```

where weights a₁=0.4, a₂=0.3, a₃=0.2, a₄=0.1 for consecutive frames.

### Multi-Subject Detection Framework

**YOLACT-Based Detection**: Real-time instance segmentation model generates prototype masks and combines mask coefficients for subject detection in Azimuth-ToF and AoD-ToF profiles.

**Adaptive Elevation Filtering**: Range-dependent elevation scope filtering eliminates interferential elevations based on human height constraints (1.5m-2.0m) and ToF information.
