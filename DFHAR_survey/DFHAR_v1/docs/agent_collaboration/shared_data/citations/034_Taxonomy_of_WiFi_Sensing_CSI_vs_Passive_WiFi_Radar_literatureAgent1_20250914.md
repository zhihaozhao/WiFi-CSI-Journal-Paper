## 🔬 Technical Framework Analysis

### System Architecture Comparison

**CSI System Architecture**:
- Intel 5300 Network Interface Card for CSI extraction
- Signal processing: DWT denoising → PCA dimension reduction → STFT spectrogram generation
- Operates at packet level (1 kHz) using preamble signals only
- Processing: 1×3×30×1k = 90k complex CSI values per second

**PWR System Architecture**:
- USRP-2921 Software-Defined Radio platform
- Signal processing: Cross Ambiguity Function → CLEAN algorithm → CFAR noise reduction
- Treats entire WiFi signal as illuminator, no packet knowledge required
- Uses portion of WiFi spectrum due to computational constraints

### Mathematical Framework Analysis

**CSI Signal Model**:
```
OFDM: x(t) = (1/√N) Σ(n=1 to N) an*e^(j2π/Ts*nt)
Received: y(t) = Σp Ap*e^(j2πfdt)*x(t-τ) + n(t)
CSI: H(fc,t) = Y(fc,t)/X(fc,t)
```

**PWR Cross Ambiguity Function**:
```
CAF(τ,fd) = ∫[0 to Ti] x(t)*y*(t-τ)*e^(j2πfd*t)dt
```

**STFT for CSI Spectrogram**:
```
X(t,k) = Σ(n=-∞ to ∞) x[n]*w[n-t]*e^(-jkn)
```

The mathematical frameworks demonstrate fundamental differences: CSI focuses on communication channel estimation while PWR employs radar signal processing principles.
