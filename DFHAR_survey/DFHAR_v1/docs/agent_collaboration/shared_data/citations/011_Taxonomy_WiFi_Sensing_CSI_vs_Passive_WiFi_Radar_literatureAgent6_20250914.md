## Comprehensive Analysis

### Abstract Summary
This paper presents a comprehensive taxonomical framework comparing Channel State Information (CSI) and Passive WiFi Radar (PWR) approaches for WiFi-based human activity recognition, addressing the fundamental question of optimal sensing modality selection for different application scenarios. Through systematic experimental evaluation involving synchronized measurements from both sensing systems, the work establishes performance benchmarks across multiple geometric configurations, activity types, and environmental conditions. The research provides crucial insights into the trade-offs between CSI and PWR methodologies, demonstrating that PWR achieves superior performance in forward scatter configurations while CSI maintains advantages in bistatic and monostatic arrangements. This taxonomical analysis represents a significant contribution to the WiFi sensing community by providing evidence-based guidance for sensing system design and deployment decisions.

### Core Technical Contributions

#### 1. Comprehensive Taxonomical Framework for WiFi Sensing Modalities
The paper establishes a systematic classification framework that distinguishes between CSI and PWR approaches across multiple dimensions:

**Sensing Modality Categorization**:
- **Channel State Information (CSI)**: Active sensing using WiFi protocol-compliant transmissions
- **Passive WiFi Radar (PWR)**: Passive sensing leveraging ambient WiFi transmissions as radar illumination
- **Geometric Configuration Impact**: Analysis across forward scatter, bistatic, and monostatic arrangements
- **Signal Processing Paradigms**: Comparison of channel estimation versus radar signal processing approaches

**Technical Differentiation Framework**:
```mathematical
CSI_response = |H(f, t)|² = |Σ_{p=1}^P α_p(t) · e^{-j2πf·τ_p(t)}|²
PWR_response = |S(f, t)|² = |FFT(r(t) ⊙ s*(t))|²
```
where H(f,t) represents CSI channel response and S(f,t) denotes PWR Doppler spectrum response.

#### 2. Systematic Performance Comparison Methodology
**Synchronized Dual-System Experimental Framework**:
The research employs a novel experimental design enabling direct performance comparison between CSI and PWR systems:

**Hardware Configuration**:
- **CSI System**: Intel 5300 NIC with 1 kHz packet transmission rate, 1×3×30 antenna configuration
- **PWR System**: USRP-2921 Software-Defined Radio platform for passive radar signal processing
- **Synchronization**: Temporal alignment enabling fair comparison of detection capabilities
- **Frequency Separation**: 2.4 GHz band with different channels to avoid mutual interference

**Geometric Configuration Analysis**:
```mathematical
Performance_metric(θ) = f(Geometry_type, Signal_strength(θ), Doppler_sensitivity(θ))
```
where θ represents the bistatic angle between transmitter-target-receiver geometry.

#### 3. Activity-Specific Performance Characterization
**Multi-Activity Evaluation Framework**:
The study establishes performance baselines across six distinct activity categories:

**Activity Classification Taxonomy**:
1. **Gross Motor Activities**: Walking (high Doppler signature)
2. **Postural Transitions**: Sitting, standing from chair/floor (moderate Doppler)
3. **Fine Motor Activities**: Picking up small items (low Doppler signature)
4. **Static Positions**: Laying down (minimal Doppler, primarily amplitude-based)

**Doppler Signature Analysis**:
```mathematical
Doppler_shift = (2 * v_radial * f_c) / c
Signature_strength ∝ |v_radial| * RCS_effective
```
where v_radial represents radial velocity component and RCS_effective denotes effective radar cross-section.

### Advanced Mathematical Framework

#### Channel State Information Theoretical Foundation
**OFDM Channel Response Modeling**:
```mathematical
H_k(t) = Σ_{l=0}^{L-1} h_l(t) · e^{-j2πkl/N}
```
where H_k(t) represents CSI for subcarrier k, h_l(t) denotes channel impulse response tap l, and N indicates FFT size.

**Activity-Induced Channel Variation**:
```mathematical
ΔH_k(t) = H_k^{activity}(t) - H_k^{static}(t)
Feature_CSI = [|ΔH_k(t)|, ∠ΔH_k(t), Var(|ΔH_k(t)|)]
```

#### Passive WiFi Radar Signal Processing Framework
**Radar Equation for WiFi Sensing**:
```mathematical
P_r = (P_t · G_t · G_r · λ² · σ) / ((4π)³ · R_t² · R_r²)
```
where P_r represents received power, σ denotes radar cross-section, R_t and R_r indicate transmitter-target and target-receiver distances.

**Doppler Processing Chain**:
```mathematical
S_doppler(f_d, t) = |FFT_t{r(t) ⊙ conj(s_ref(t))}|²
```
where r(t) represents received signal, s_ref(t) denotes reference signal, and f_d indicates Doppler frequency.

#### Geometric Configuration Impact Analysis
**Bistatic Angle Sensitivity**:
```mathematical
Doppler_bistatic = (2 * f_c / c) * v_radial * cos(θ/2)
```
where θ represents bistatic angle and v_radial denotes target radial velocity.

**Forward Scatter Enhancement**:
```mathematical
RCS_forward = |4π · A_physical² / λ²|
```
demonstrating enhanced radar cross-section in forward scatter geometry.
