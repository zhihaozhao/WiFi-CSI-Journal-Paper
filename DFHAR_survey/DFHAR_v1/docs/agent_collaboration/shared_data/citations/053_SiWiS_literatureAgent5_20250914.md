## Problem Statement and Motivation

SiWiS addresses critical fundamental limitations of existing WiFi Channel State Information (CSI) based sensing approaches that have plagued the field for years. The paper identifies two major challenges:

1. **Multi-device Dependency**: Traditional CSI-based sensing requires at least two WiFi devices (transmitter and receiver), creating deployment complexity and limiting practical applicability.

2. **Phase Incoherence**: Due to carrier phase offset (CPO) between separate TX and RX devices, CSI-based methods suffer from random phase information across packets, preventing reliable phase-coherent sensing and limiting generalization to new environments.

The authors demonstrate that existing CSI phase information is essentially random across consecutive packets, making it impossible to derive meaningful movement information from phase changes - a critical limitation for fine-grained sensing applications.

## Technical Innovation and Approach

### Core Innovation: Self-Mixing Architecture

SiWiS introduces a groundbreaking **single-device sensing architecture** that achieves phase-coherent sensing through a novel self-mixing design:

1. **Hardware Component**: Custom RF circuit with patch antennas that can be attached to commercial WiFi devices
2. **Signal Processing**: Self-mixing of WiFi OFDM signals using local ambient WiFi signals as Local Oscillator (LO)
3. **Phase Coherence**: Eliminates CFO, STO, and CPO issues by co-locating transmitter and receiver

### Mathematical Foundation

The paper provides rigorous mathematical analysis showing that SiWiS achieves a **deterministic linear relationship** between observed signal phase and object movement distance:

- For single moving object: `arg([Y]_ac)` is linear function of object distance `d`
- Feature extraction based on L-LTF (Legacy Long Training Field) summation ensures stable measurements
- Experimental validation shows phase change of 14.5 radians corresponding to 11.9 cm movement (theoretical) vs 12.5 cm measured

### Deep Learning Architecture

**Dual-Branch DNN Design**:
- **Signal Encoder**: Convolutional layers + self-attention blocks for temporal feature extraction
- **Cross-Attention Mechanism**: Establishes fine-grained spatial pixel connections
- **Concurrent Tasks**: Simultaneous human mask segmentation and pose estimation
