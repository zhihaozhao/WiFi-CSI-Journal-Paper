 abstract = {As AI for Science continues to grow, Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have emerged as a transformative approach within the realm of scientific computing and deep learning, offering a robust and flexible framework for solving partial differential equa­ tions (PDEs) and other complex physical systems. By embedding physical laws directly into the architecture of neural networks, PINNs enable the integration of domain-specific knowledge, ensuring that the models adhere to known physics while fitting available data. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art advancements and applications of PINNs across a broad spectrum of PDE problems. In particular, focus is given on the PINN architectures, data resampling methods for PINN, loss and activa­ tion functions, feature embedding methods and so on. What’s more, the potential future directions and the anticipated evolution of PINNs are also discussed. We aim to provide valuable insights into PINNs for PDE problems, with hope to encourage further explora­ tion and research in this promising area.},

 abstract = {Cross-Domain WiFi Sensing with Channel State Information: A Survey CHEN CHEN, School of Data Science and Engineering, South China Normal University GANG ZHOU, Computer Science Department, William & Mary YOUFANG LIN, School of Computer and Information Technology, Beijing Jiaotong University The past years have witnessed the rapid conceptualization and development of wireless sensing based on Channel State Information (CSI) with commodity WiFi devices. Recent studies have demonstrated the vast potential of WiFi sensing in detection, recognition, and estimation applications. However, the widespread de- ployment of WiFi sensing systems still faces a significant challenge: how to ensure the sensing performance when exposing a pre-trained sensing system to new domains, such as new environments, different configura- tions, and unseen users, without data collection and system retraining. This survey provides a comprehensive review of recent research efforts on cross-domain WiFi Sensing. We first introduce the mathematical model of CSI and explore the impact of different domains on CSI. Then we present a general workflow of cross-domain WiFi sensing systems, which consists of signal processing and cross-domain sensing. Five cross-domain sens- ing algorithms, including domain-invariant feature extraction, virtual sample generation, transfer learning, few-shot learning and big data solution, are summarized to show how they achieve high sensing accuracy when encountering new domains.

Recently, deep- learning-based end-to-end training has pushed the state-of-the-art performance in domains such as computer vision and natural language, where large amounts of annotated data are available. However, large quantities of annotated data are typically not available for sensor-based HAR. Moreover, the real-world settings on which HAR is performed differ in terms of sensor modalities, classification tasks, and target users. To address this problem, transfer learning has been explored extensively. In this survey, we focus on these transfer learning methods in the application domains of smart home and wearables-based HAR. In particular, we provide a problem–solution perspective by categorizing and presenting the works in terms of their contributions and the challenges they address. We present an overview of the state of the art for both application domains. Based on our analysis of 246 papers, we highlight the gaps in the literature and provide a roadmap for addressing these.

Through an exten- sive survey of existing literature in the area of WiFi sensing, we discover common signal processing techniques and evaluate the applicability of these techniques for online edge systems. Based on these techniques, we develop a topology of compo- nents required for a low-cost WiFi sensing system and develop a low-cost WiFi sensing system using ESP32 IoT microcontroller edge devices. We perform numerous real world WiFi sensing experiments to thoroughly evaluate machine learning prediction accuracy by performing Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE) hyperparameter optimization to independently identify optimal hyperparameters for each method. Additionally, we evaluate our system directly on-board the ESP32 with respect to com- putation time per method and overall sample throughput rate. Through this evaluation, we demonstrate how an edge WiFi sens- ing system enables online machine learning through the use of on-device inference and thus can be used for ubiquitous WiFi sensing system deployments.},

However, once launched in real applications, the high-accuracy pattern recognition systems may become unstable and unreliable, due to the lack of robustness in open and changing environments. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research to- wards robust pattern recognition from the perspective of breaking three basic and implicit assumptions: closed-world assumption, independent and identically distributed assumption, and clean and big data assumption, which form the foundation of most pattern recognition models. Actually, our brain is robust at learning concepts continually and incrementally, in complex, open and changing environments, with different contexts, modalities and tasks, by showing only a few examples, under weak or noisy supervision. These are the major differences between human intelligence and machine intelligence, which are closely related to the above three assumptions. After witnessing the signiﬁcant progress in accuracy improvement nowadays, this review paper will enable us to analyze the shortcomings and limitations of current methods and identify future research directions for robust pattern recognition.},

However, its application faces challenges due to limited generalizabil- ity, necessitating frequent data recollection and neural network retraining for adaptation to new environments. To address these limitations, some researchers introduced few-shot learning into Wi-Fi sensing applications because it offers a promising solution with its ability to achieve remarkable performance in novel scenarios using minimal training sam- ples. Despite its potential, a comprehensive review of its applications within this domain remains absent. This study endeavors to fill this gap by exploring prominent Wi-Fi sensing applications that incorporate few-shot learning, aiming to delineate their key features. We categorize few-shot learning approaches into three distinct methodologies: transfer learn- ing, metric learning, and meta-learning, based on their neural network training strategies. Through this classification, we examine representative systems from an application per- spective and elucidate the principles of few-shot learning implementation. These systems are evaluated in terms of learning methodology, data modality, and recognition accuracy.

Due to the complex relationship between human activities and WiFi CSI measurements, the accuracies of current recognition systems are far from satisfactory. In this paper, we propose a new deep learning based approach, i.e., attention based bi-directional long short-term memory (ABLSTM), for passive human activity recognition using WiFi CSI signals. The BLSTM is employed to learn representative features in two directions from raw sequential CSI measurements. Since the learned features may have different contributions for ﬁnal activity recognition, we leverage on an attention mechanism to assign different weights for all the learned features. Real experiments have been carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed ABLSTM for human activity recognition. The experimental results show that our proposed ABLSTM is able to achieve the best recognition performance for all activities when compared with some benchmark approaches.},

 abstract = {task in the ﬁeld of human-computer interaction. Given the pene- tration of WiFi devices in our daily lives, HAR using WiFi channel state information (CSI) is a more cost-efﬁcient and comfortable ap- proach. However, most existing approaches ignore the correlation between CSI sub-carriers, which makes their models inefﬁcient and need to rely on deeper and more complex networks to fur- ther improve performance. To solve these problems, we propose a reconstructed WiFi CSI phase based HAR approach (WiPhase), which contains a two-stream model to fuse both temporal features and sub-carrier correlation features of reconstructed CSI phase. Speciﬁcally, a gated pseudo-Siamese network (GPSiam) is designed to capture the temporal features of the reconstructed sparse CSI phase integration representation (CSI-PIR), and a dynamic resolu- tionbasedgraphattentionnetwork(DRGAT)isdesignedtocapture the nonlinear correlation between CSI sub-carriers by the recon- structed CSI phase graph. Furthermore, dendrite network (DD) makes the ﬁnal decision by combining the features output from GPSiam and DRGAT.

However, integrated sensing and commu- nication (ISAC) unlocks a new era of mobile network capabilities, with WiFi emerging as a prime candidate. By leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure and frequencies, ISAC enables powerful services like accurate localization and human activity recognition (HAR). WiFi-based HAR is a prime example powered by the magic of ISAC. WiFi channel state information (CSI) is susceptible to human movement disturbances; the alterations in CSI mirror the dynamic attributes of human activities. Given the intricate relationship between human activities and CSI, numer- ous deep learning models have been introduced to enhance HAR accuracy. Recently, transformer-based models have achieved excellent performance in various tasks, including speech recog- nition, natural language processing, and image classiﬁcation. This has spurred research into incorporating transformer-based models into WiFi sensing applications. However, their application in WiFi-based HAR remains nascent. Vision transformer (ViT) is well-suited for analyzing WiFi CSI signals in the form of spectra, such as the Doppler frequency spectrum frequently utilized in related studies, owing to its data structure mimicking that of images.

To achieve this, we devise a new technique to clean and process the channel frequency response (CFR) phase of the Wi-Fi channel, obtaining an estimate of the Doppler shift at a radio monitor device. The Doppler shift reveals the presence of moving scatterers in the environment, while not being affected by (environment-speciﬁc) static objects. SHARP is trained on data collected as a person performs seven different activities in a single environment. It is then tested on different setups, to assess its performance as the person, the day and/or the environment change with respect to those considered at training time. In the worst-case scenario, it reaches an average accuracy higher than 95%, validating the effectiveness of the extracted Doppler information, used in conjunction with a learning algorithm based on a neural network, in recognizing human activities in a subject and environment independent way. The collected CFR dataset and the code are publicly available for replicability and benchmarking purposes [1].},

 abstract = {ﬁeld of human-computer interaction (HCI) and Internet of things system. Compared with the existing technologies based on wearable sensors and dedicated devices, approaches using WiFi channel state information (CSI) signals are more desirable for passive and ﬁne-grained gesture recognition. However, the existing CSI-based gesture recognition systems usually suffer from high model complexity and low accuracy caused by environmental dynamics. To address these issues, we propose a robust gesture recognition system (WiHGR) in this paper. The WiHGR starts with a sparse recovery method to ﬁnd the dominant paths from the multipath effect introduced by orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology, i.e., the main propagation paths dis- turbed by a human gesture. Then, the phase difference matrix is constructed according to the phase differences between two adjacent receiving antennas from the dominant paths. We propose a modiﬁed attention based bi-directional gate recurrent unit (ABGRU) network to learn and extract dis- criminative features automatically from the phase difference matrix. The proposed attention mechanism assigns higher weights to the more important features, thus achieving a better recognition performance. Experimental results show that the WiHGR not only has a high accuracy for gesture recognition in the training environment, but also has a remarkable performance in new environment settings without retraining.},

 abstract = {due to the increasing requirement of high-speed Internet access. Recently, besides network services, WiFi sensing is appealing in smart homes since it is device-free, cost-effective and privacy- preserving. Though numerous WiFi sensing methods have been developed, most of them only consider single smart home scenario. Without the connection of powerful cloud server and massive users, large-scale WiFi sensing is still difﬁcult. In this paper, we ﬁrstly analyze and summarize these obstacles, and propose an efﬁcient large-scale WiFi sensing framework, namely EfﬁcientFi. The EfﬁcientFi works with edge computing at WiFi APs and cloud computing at center servers. It consists of a novel deep neural network that can compress ﬁne-grained WiFi Chan- nel State Information (CSI) at edge, restore CSI at cloud, and perform sensing tasks simultaneously. A quantized auto-encoder and a joint classiﬁer are designed to achieve these goals in an end-to-end fashion. To the best of our knowledge, the EfﬁcientFi is the ﬁrst IoT-cloud-enabled WiFi sensing framework that signiﬁcantly reduces communication overhead while realizing sensing tasks accurately. We utilized human activity recognition and identiﬁcation via WiFi sensing as two case studies, and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the EfﬁcientFi. The results show that it compresses CSI data from 1.368Mb/s to 0.768Kb/s with extremely low error of data reconstruction and achieves over 98% accuracy for human activity recognition.},

 abstract = {remarkable advances in WiFi-based human gesture recogni- tion (HGR) using channel state information (CSI). However, since the CSI patterns of the same gesture change across domains (i.e., users, environments, locations, and orientations), recognition accuracy might degrade signiﬁcantly when applying the trained model to new domains. To overcome this problem, we propose a WiFi-based cross-domain gesture recognition system (WiGr) which has a domain-transferable mapping to construct an embed- ding space where the representations of samples from the same class are clustered, and those from different classes are separated. The key insight of WiGr is using the similarity between the query sample representation and the class prototypes in the embedding space to perform the gesture classiﬁcation, which can avoid the inﬂuence of the cross-domain CSI patterns change. Meanwhile, we present a dual-path prototypical network (Dual-Path PN) which consists of a deep feature extractor and a dual-path (i.e., Path-A and Path-B substructures) recognizer. The trained feature extractor can extract the gesture-related domain-independent features from CSI, namely, the domain-transferable mapping. In addition, WiGr implements the cross-domain HGR based on only a pair of WiFi devices without retraining in the new domain. We conduct comprehensive experiments on three data sets, one is built by ourselves and the others are public data sets. The evaluation suggests that WiGr achieves 86.8%–92.7% in-domai...},

Due to limited bandwidth and uncertain wireless environment, FEEL may impose heavy burden to the current communication system. In addition, under the common FEEL framework, the server needs to wait for the slowest device to complete the up- date uploading before starting the aggregation process, leading to the straggler issue that causes prolonged communication time. In this paper, we propose to accelerate FEEL from two aspects: i.e., 1) performing data compression on the edge devices and 2) setting a deadline on the edge server to exclude the straggler devices.

 abstract = {high-rate packets for accurate sensing. These “sensing packets” greatly affect the main data communication function of WiFi and signiﬁcantly counteract the promised beneﬁt of reusing WiFi communication for sensing. In this work, we propose WiImg2.0, a lightweight system which involves machine learning techniques to enable WiFi sensing under low packet rate, pushing WiFi sensing one step towards real-life adoption. The key idea is to convert the WiFi CSI samples into images and employ the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for CSI image inpainting, relaxing the requirement of high sample rate for sensing. We ﬁrst recover the sensing data from the antenna spatial domain and then from the sample time domain. To avoid the large training overhead of GAN, we design a lightweight GAN that leverages samples of only three rates in a ﬁxed window to recover the CSI traces of arbitrary rates and varying duration. Experiments show that with just 25 packets per second, WiImg2.0 is able to increase the recognition accuracy for hand gesture recognition and daily activity tracking from the state-of-the-art 59.1% and 65.9% to 86.7% and 96.4%, respectively.},

@article{feng2019wi,

Many existing works achieved desirable performance in various applications, including healthcare, security, and Internet of Things, with dif- ferent machine learning algorithms. However, they usually fail to consider the availability of enough samples to be trained. Besides, many applications only focus on the scenario where only single subject presents. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a three-phase system Wi-multi that targets at recogniz- ing multiple human activities in a wireless environment. Different system phases are applied according to the size of available col- lected samples. Speciﬁcally, distance-based classiﬁcation using dynamic time warping is applied when there are few samples in the proﬁle. Then, support vector machine is employed when representative features can be extracted from training samples. Lastly, recurrent neural networks is exploited when a large num- ber of samples are available. Extensive experiments results show that Wi-multi achieves an accuracy of 96.1% on average. It is also able to achieve a desirable tradeoff between accuracy and efﬁciency in different phases.},

Previous works either depend on customized hardware or need a priori learning of wireless signal patterns, facing downsides in terms of the privacy concern, availability and reliability. In this paper, we propose CentiTrack, the ﬁrst centimeter-level passive gesture tracking system that works with only three commodity WiFi devices, without any extra hardware modiﬁcations or wearable sensors. To this end, we ﬁrst identify the Channel State Information (CSI) measurement error sources in the physical layer process, and then denoise CSI by the complex ratio between adjacent antennas. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is further adopted to separate the reﬂected signals from noises. Benchmark experiments are conducted to verify that the phase changes of denoised CSI are proportional to the length changes of dynamic path reﬂected off the hand. In addition, we adopt the Multiple Signal Classiﬁcation (MUSIC) algorithm to estimate the Angle-of-Arrivals (AoAs) of dynamic paths, and then locate the initial position of hands with triangulation. We also propose a novel static componnets elimination algorithm for tracking correction by eliminating the components unrelated to motion. A prototype of CentiTrack is fully realized and evaluated in various real scenarios. Extensive experiments show that CentiTrack is superior in terms of tracking accuracy, sensing range and device cost, compared with the state-of-the-arts.},

@article{han2023federated,
 abstract = {edge has introduced several research challenges. One is the need for a machine learning architecture that achieves personalization (to individual clients) and generalization (to unseen data) properties concurrently across different applications. Another is the need for an inference strategy that can satisfy network resource and latency constraints during testing-time. Existing techniques in federated learning have encountered a steep trade-off between personaliza- tion and generalization, and have not explicitly considered the resource requirements during the inference-stage. In this paper, we propose SplitGP, a joint edge-AI training and inference strategy that simultaneously captures generalization/personalization for ef- ﬁcient inference across resource-constrained clients. The training process of SplitGP is based on federated split learning, with the key idea of optimizing the client-side model to have personal- ization capability tailored to its main task, while training the server-side model to have generalization capability for handling out-of-distribution tasks. During testing-time, each client selec- tively ofﬂoads inference tasks to the server based on the uncer- tainty threshold tunable based on network resource availability. Through formal convergence analysis and inference time analysis, we provide guidelines on the selection of key meta-parameters in SplitGP. Experimental results conﬁrm the advantage of SplitGP over existing baselines.},

FingerPass separates the user authentication process into two stages, login and interaction, to achieve high authentication accuracy and low response latency simultaneously. In the login stage, we develop a deep learning-based approach to extract behavioral characteristics of ﬁnger gestures for highly accurate user identiﬁcation. For the interaction stage, to provide continuous authentication in real time for satisfactory user experience, we design a veriﬁcation mechanism with lightweight classiﬁers to continuously authenticate the user’s identity during each interaction of ﬁnger gestures. Experiments in real environments show that FingerPass can achieve the authentication accuracies of 90.6 percent under in-domain scenarios and 87.6 percent under cross-domain scenarios, as well as 186:6 ms response time during interactions.},

Therefore, this paper aims to demon- strate cross-domain wireless sensing in a more challenging do- main generalization (DG) setting without multiple transceivers or target domain data. Speciﬁcally, we propose a style-randomized cross-domain wireless sensing model called WiSR, which extracts domain-invariant features from multiple source domains. It quan- tiﬁes Channel State Information (CSI) differences in the subcarrier dimensions as subcarrier-domain styles and instructs the feature extractor to gradually bias the gesture signals by randomizing the subcarrier-domain styles at the feature level. Meanwhile, a domain classiﬁer that shares the same feature extractor is instructed to gradually bias the domain signals by randomizing the gesture fea- tures. Then, an adversarial training framework enables the domain classiﬁer to reduce the inﬂuence of domain signals on the feature extractor. Extensive experiments have been performed on three gesture datasets with varying amounts of subcarriers from devices with different NICs, including cross-one-factor (such as room, user, location, and orientation) and cross-multi-factor sensing tasks. The results demonstrate that our method considerably increases performance on wireless DG tasks.},

It is natural to consider using a quantum processor based on microwave superconducting circuits to classify microwave signals that are analog—continuous in time. However, while there have been theoretical proposals of analog QRC, to date QRC has been implemented using the circuit model—imposing a discretization of the incoming signal in time. In this paper we show how a quantum superconducting circuit comprising an oscillator coupled to a qubit can be used as an analog quantum reservoir for a variety of classification tasks, achieving high accuracy on all of them. Our work demonstrates processing of ultra-low-power microwave signals within our superconducting circuit, a step towards achieving a quantum sensing-computational advantage on impinging microwave signals.},

However, the channel state information (CSI) measured by a WiFi receiver suffers from errors in both its gain and phase, which can significantly hinder sensing tasks. By analyzing these errors from different WiFi receivers, a mathematical model for these gain and phase errors is devel- oped in this work. Based on these models, several theoretically justified preprocessing algorithms for correcting such errors at a receiver and, thus, obtaining clean CSI are presented. Simulation results show that at typical system parameters, the developed algorithms for cleaning CSI can reduce noise by 40% and 200%, respectively, compared to baseline methods for gain correction and phase correction, without significantly impacting computational cost. The superiority of the proposed methods is also validated in a real-world test bed for respiration rate monitoring (an example sensing task), where they improve the estimation signal-to-noise ratio by 20% compared to baseline methods.},

Since it is expensive to label enough new data for retaining a model, it is beneﬁcial to explore few-shot learning for cross-domain sensing with limited target labels. Nevertheless, there are two challenges to be addressed. The ﬁrst challenge is how to select a suitable dataset from a series of available source domains to prevent negative transfer. The second is to mine action-related charac- teristics by the feature learning model for the following effective knowledge transfer. In order to tackle the above challenges, we present a cross-domain sensing framework named CDFi, which consists of Nearest Neighbor based Domain Selector (NNDS) and Fine-to-Coarse-Grained Transformer Network (FCGTN). NNDS is proposed to evaluate the source-target domain similarities by mea- surements among local and global feature distributions. Besides, FCGTN embeds convolution map based hierarchical transformer structures and the modiﬁed linear layer into an end-to-end deep network, which can quickly adapt to the unseen domain by few samples. Comprehensive experiments show that CDFi can effec- tively realize cross-domain action recognition, and achieve about 4% and 10% improvement on cross-user and cross-scene cases, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art.},

Feder- ated learning enables edge nodes to collaboratively train a shared prediction model without sharing data.

In this paper, we propose a ﬁne-grained training strategy for federated learning to accelerate its convergence rate in MEC with dynamic community. Based on multi-agent reinforcement learning, the proposed scheme enables each edge node to adaptively adjust its training strategy (aggre- gation timing and frequency) according to the network dynamics, while compromising with each other to improve the convergence of federated learning. To further adapt to the dynamic community in MEC, we propose a meta-learning-based scheme where new nodes can learn from other nodes and quickly perform scene migration to further accelerate the convergence of federated learning.

In this paper, we propose a novel augmented environment- invariant robust WiFi gesture recognition system named AirFi that deals with the issue of environment dependency from a new perspective. The AirFi is a novel domain generalization framework that learns the critical part of CSI regardless of different environments and generalizes the model to unseen scenarios, which does not require collecting any data for adaptation to the new environment.

 abstract = {has become a research hotspot, and great progress has been made in ubiquitous computing. Among the different kinds of implementations, activity recognition based on WiFi chan- nel state information (CSI) has attracted enormous attention for its superiority compared with conventional approaches. In this article, a device-free human continuous activity recog- nition system based on WiFi CSI is proposed. First, the CSI phase difference expansion matrix is constructed as a more obvious activity recognition feature, and a method based on threshold combined with labeling is used to achieve con- tinuous activity segmentation. Then, the Gaussian mixture model–hidden Markov model (GMM–HMM) is used to model the CSI feature data of each activity, which is originally used for human 3-D skeleton-based activity recognition. The approachis of greatvalue not only for its high accuracy compared with other classiﬁcationapproaches,such as long short- term memory (LSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN), but also for its tremendous advantage that a pretty short CSI time series could be used to identify human activities, thus saving computer memory, reducing system calculation time greatly, and improving the error tolerance rate of the segmentation. Experiments on measured activity datasets and methods comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed system. The factors affecting system performance, such as the length of the CSI time series, have been discussed in thi...},

 abstract = {WiFi-based human activity recogni- tion (HAR) has emerged as a promising technique for human–computer interactions, owing to its widespread avail- ability and noninvasiveness. However, deploying WiFi-based HAR systems in new environments often results in performance degradation. Existing WiFi-based HAR systems across different environments typically assume identical category spaces between the source and target, an assumption challenged by practical scenarios. In this article, we present WiCAU, a comprehensive adaptation with uncertainty awareness for WiFi-based HAR across environments, designed to tackle the challenges of envi- ronments with unequal category spaces—a scenario known as partial domain adaptation (PDA). Different from conventional PDA methods that usually focus on training the feature extractor to align feature distributions or implement separate reweighting models to adjust source domain feature weights, WiCAU inte- grates feature alignment and source data reweighting to mitigate the risk of negative transfer. It also introduces an uncertain complement entropy to effectively handle uncertainty within the source environment. Moreover, WiCAU uses a hybrid network that combines wavelet analysis with deep neural networks to capture both the temporal and spatial dynamics present in WiFi channel state information (CSI) data.

ABSTRACT Human activity recognition based on channel state information (CSI) using commercial WiFi devices plays an increasingly important role in many applications, such as smart home and interactive games. In this paper, we propose a WiFi CSI based human activity recognition approach using deep recurrent neural network (HARNN). HARNN mainly exploits four key techniques to recognize different human activities. HARNN ﬁrstly constructs a novel two-level decision tree for using two environment variation statistics efﬁciently. Meanwhile, a linear regression method is also introduced to seek for the optimal parameter for the designed decision tree. Depending on this, the decision tree is used to sense indoor environment variation, and then detect whether there is any human activity occurring in a target area. In addition, a noise removal mechanism is devised to eliminate the inﬂuence of random noise derived from indoor environments. Then, to characterize various human activi...},

 abstract = {In the last two decades, smart buildings have profited from AI- based approaches to create smart applications that provide several advantages such as energy efficiency and security. In particular, occupancy estimation (OE) and activity recognition (AR) are vi- tal solutions that study the frequency and behavior of occupants within a building. The smart building labeled data is scarce, and its collection is costly, tedious, time-consuming, and can be infeasible due to privacy issues. Researchers have considered unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) techniques to solve the problem of data scarcity by sharing knowledge from source domains where labeled data is abundant to target domains where labeled data is not avail- able. In previous research, domain adaptation approaches learn invariant feature representations from both source and target do- mains to allow knowledge transfer across domains. In this work, we consider unsupervised adversarial domain adaptation (UADA) to estimate the occupants’ number and recognize their activities. Ad- versarial learning develops a discriminator to distinguish between samples from source and target domains and a feature extractor to fool this discriminator which creates better domain-invariant feature representations or it learns transferable feature represen- tations by embedding an adversarial learning module within a deep learning model. We adapt 4 UADA approaches called Drop to Adapt (DTA), Drop to Adapt with Virtual Adversarial Training (D...},

Recent works in this area have made substantial progress, but CTC from ZigBee to WiFi remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose ZigFi, a novel CTC framework that enables communication from ZigBee to WiFi. ZigFi carefully overlaps ZigBee packets with WiFi packets. Through experiments we show that Channel State Informa- tion (CSI) of the overlapped packets can be used to convey data from ZigBee to WiFi. Based on this ﬁnding, we propose a receiver-initiated protocol and translate the decoding problem into a problem of CSI classiﬁcation with Support Vector Machine. We further build a generic model through experiments, which describes the relationship between the Signal to Interference and Noise Ratio (SINR) and the symbol error rate (SER). Moreover, we extend ZigFi to multiple-to-one concurrent trans- missions. We implement ZigFi on commercial-off-the-shelf WiFi and ZigBee devices. We evaluate the performance of ZigFi under different experimental settings. The results demonstrate that ZigFi achieves a throughput of 215.9bps, which is 18X faster than the state of the arts.},

We provide com- prehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers—8× deeper than VGG nets [41] but still having lower complex- ity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57% error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classiﬁcation task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks.

Recently, some state-of-the-art WiFi-based HAR systems have been presented due to its characteristics of no-invasion, no privacy leakage, and high recognition accuracy rates (RARs). How- ever, the commodity WiFi devices for identiﬁcation are usually in a complex electromagnetic environment, where the interference caused by WiFi devices from channel overlap is common and severe. Furthermore, our extensive experiments show that the per- formance of these pioneer WiFi-based HAR systems may degrade signiﬁcantly in co-channel interference (CCI) scenarios. To solve the above problem, we propose WiAnti, a WiFi-based HAR system that is robust to CCI. Two adaptive subcarrier selection algorithms, WiAnti-Pearson and WiAnti-DTW, are proposed to mitigate the impact of CCI and to improve the recognition performance in CCI scenarios. As demonstrated in the experimental results, WiAnti- Pearson yields a 95% RAR on average, which can improve up to a 14% RAR in the presence of constant CCI. Moreover, WiAnti- DTW achieves an 8% higher RAR in the varying CCI scenario, reaching 94%.},

 abstract = {Despite their impressive performance on various tasks, vision transformers (ViTs) are heavy for mobile vision applications. Recent works have proposed combining the strengths of ViTs and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to build lightweight networks. Still, these approaches rely on hand-designed architectures with a pre-determined number of parameters. In this work, we address the challenge of ﬁnding optimal light-weight ViTs given constraints on model size and computational cost using neural architecture search. We use a search algorithm that considers both model parameters and on-device deployment latency. This method analyzes network properties, hardware memory access pattern, and degree of parallelism to directly and accurately estimate the network latency. To prevent the need for extensive testing during the search process, we use a lookup table based on a detailed breakdown of the speed of each component and operation, which can be reused to evaluate the whole latency of each search structure. Our approach leads to improved efﬁciency compared to testing the speed of the whole model during the search process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under similar parameters and FLOPs, our searched lightweight ViTs achieve higher accuracy and lower latency than state-of-the-art models. For instance, on ImageNet-1K, AutoViT_XXS (71.3% Top-1 accuracy, 10.2ms latency) outperforms MobileViTv3_XXS (71.0% Top-1 accuracy, 12.5ms latency) with 0.3% higher accuracy and 2.3ms lo...},

@inproceedings{mei2021wiwave,
 abstract = {(HAR), as a key enabler of building smart home, has gained tremendous attention because of its superior properties such as privacy protection and low-cost deployment. Since each human motion within the signal coverage would cause different wireless channel disturbances, it is possible to identify and interpret these activity-induced signal changes for human behavior recognition. Although many approaches attempt to extract distinct patterns from WiFi measurements corresponding to user activities, the signals can be easily attenuated due to environmental variations in the real settings, so that their recognition accuracy may be severely deteriorated. In order to extract the key features in a more distinguished way, in this paper, we propose WiWave, a WiFi-based device-free HAR system leveraging wavelet inte- grated convolutional neural network (CNN). Instead of utilizing pooling operations, our proposed network has introduced discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the convolutional architectures, which can combine the good time-frequency local characteristics of the wavelet transform with the self-learning ability of the neu- ral network. Consequently, not only high-level features from low- frequency components can be obtained automatically, but also the the size of feature map can be reduced. The experiment results demonstrate that WiWave achieves average 94.87% accuracy for distinguishing ten actions in real-world home environment.},

But the behaviours developed by agents in simulation are often speciﬁc to the characteristics of the simulator. Due to modeling error, strategies that are successful in simulation may not transfer to their real world counterparts. In this paper, we demonstrate a simple method to bridge this “reality gap”. By randomizing the dynamics of the simulator during training, we are able to develop policies that are capable of adapting to very different dynamics, including ones that differ signiﬁcantly from the dynamics on which the policies were trained. This adaptivity enables the policies to generalize to the dynamics of the real world without any training on the physical system. Our approach is demonstrated on an object pushing task using a robotic arm. Despite being trained exclusively in simulation, our policies are able to maintain a similar level of performance when deployed on a real robot, reliably moving an object to a desired location from random initial conﬁgurations. We explore the impact of various design decisions and show that the resulting policies are robust to signiﬁcant calibration error.},

While camera-based systems have traditionally been used for this purpose, they raise privacy concerns. To address this issue, recent research has explored the use of wireless channel state information (CSI) extracted from commercial WiFi access points (APs) to provide detailed channel characteristics. In this article, we propose a device-free human presence detection system for multiroom scenarios using a time-selective conditional dual feature extract recurrent network (TCD-FERN). Our system is designed to capture significant time features on current human features using a dynamic and static (DaS) data preprocessing technique. We extract both moving and spatial features of people and differentiate between line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) cases. Subcarrier fusion is carried out to provide more objective variation of each sample while reducing the computational complexity. A voting scheme is further adopted to mitigate the feature attenuation problem caused by room partitions, with around 3% improvement of human presence detection accuracy. Experimental results have revealed the significant improvement of leveraging subcarrier fusion, dual-feature recurrent network, time selection, and con- dition mechanisms. Compared to the existing works in open literature, our proposed TCD-FERN system can achieve above 97% of human presence detection accuracy for multiroom scenarios wi...},

Existing approaches, though yielding reasonably acceptable performances, are suffering from two major drawbacks: heavy empirical dependency and large computational complexity. In order to solve these issues, we develop LiteWiSys in this article, a lightweight system in an end-to-end deep learning manner to simultaneously detect and recognize WiFi-based human actions. Specifically, we assign different attentions on sub-carriers, which are then compressed to reduce noise and information redundancy. Then, LiteWiSys integrates deep separable convolution and a channel shuffle mechanism into a multi-scale convolutional backbone structure. By feature channel split, two network branches are obtained and further trained with a joint loss function for dual tasks. We collect different datasets at multi-scenes and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance of LiteWiSys.

Moreover, they are unable to make full use of the target data with only the labelled samples taken into consideration. To cope with these issues, we propose a WiFi-based sensing system, MetaFormer, which can effectively recognize actions from unseen domains with only one labelled target sample per category.

@article{zhang2023imgfi,
 abstract = {human activity recognition (HAR) based on WiFi channel state information (CSI) has been widely studied, as the CSI signal is susceptible to the external environment, a recognition framework with high accuracy and low complexity remains a key and difficult problem. To improve WiFi sensing performance and reduce model complexity, ImgFi, a gesture recognition system, is proposed, which includes a conversion module and a recognition mod- ule. The conversion module is used to convert the CSI to images, and the key difference of the proposed ImgFi is using signal variations in arbitrarily different timestamps as feature extraction units rather than single signal points. This conversion can also take advantage of the powerful ability of the convolutional neural network (CNN) in the field of image recognition. Five CSI imaging approaches are introduced in ImgFi to realize the CSI conversion while a CNN is designed to recognize the activity from the converted images. To verify the proposed framework, we make some tests in our laboratory and get a dataset. The tests on four datasets under different contexts indicate that ImgFi with only three convolutional layers achieves 99.5% recognition accuracy. That is, our method has higher accuracy and lower complexity, which is important to related applications, such as smart homes and virtual reality. We will publish our code at https://github.com/shengjunzi/ImgFi.},

 abstract = {TomFi: Small Object Tracking Using Commodity WiFi XIAOBIN ZHANG and HONGZHE XU, Xi’an Jiaotong University JIANWEI LIU and JINSONG HAN, Zhejiang University Rodent infestation has always been one of the most severe threats to humans, which to solve consumes massive manpower and resources. People usually use traps or poisons to treat rat infestation. Such passive countermeasures are inefficient. Damage often occurs when the rats are finally trapped or killed, not to men- tion the potential risk to injure humans or cause pollution. In this article, we propose a WiFi-based active small object tracking system named TomFi. The core components of TomFi include several deep learning techniques that bridge rat locations/motions and WiFi signal variations (represented by the channel state information). TomFi first employs a detection model to detect the appearance of the rat and then localize it based on a two-branch localization model. Through the design of the two-branch localization model, to our best knowledge, we are the first to solve the information loss and distortion problem. We conducted exten- sive experiments in both the laboratory environment and real-world kitchen scenarios. The results show that TomFi can achieve a detection success rate of 99%+ and a centimeter-level localization accuracy in real time.

@article{zhao2024enabling,
 abstract = {applications. However, current RFID sensing can obtain mainly a single-dimensional sensing measurement from each reader-to- tag query, such as phase, RSS, etc. This is sufficient to fulfill the designs that are bound to the tag’s movement, e.g., the localization of tags. However, it imposes inevitable uncertainty on many sensing tasks relying on the features extracted from the RFID signals. These traditional sensing measurements limit the fidelity of RFID sensing fundamentally and prevent its broader usage in more sophisticated sensing scenarios. This paper presents RF-Wise to push the limit of RFID-based sensing, motivated by an insightful observation to customize RFID signals. RF-Wise can enrich the existing single-dimensional feature measure to a channel state information (CSI)-like measure with up to 150- dimensional samples across different frequencies concurrently. More importantly, RF-Wise is a software solution atop the standard EPC Gen2 protocol without using any extra hardware. It requires only one tag for sensing and works within the ISM band. RF-Wise, so far as we know, is the first system of such a kind. Extensive experiments show that RF-Wise does not impact underlying RFID communications, while by using the features extracted by RF-Wise, applications’ sensing performance can be improved remarkably. The source codes of RF-Wise are available at https://cui-zhao.github.io/RF-WISE/.},

 abstract = {nication (CTC) from IEEE 802.11b to LoRa but has a low efficiency due to the extremely asymmetric data rates. In this paper, we propose WiRa that emulates LoRa waveform with IEEE 802.11ax. By taking advantage of the OFDMA in 802.11ax, WiRa uses only a small Resource Unit (RU) to emulate LoRa chirps and sets other RUs free for high-rate WiFi users. WiRa carefully selects the RU and adopts WiFi frame aggregation to emulate the long LoRa frame. We propose a subframe header mapping method to identify and remove invalid symbols caused by irremovable subframe headers in the aggregated frame. We also propose a mode flipping method to solve Cyclic Prefix (CP) errors, based on our finding that different CP modes have different impacts on the LoRa symbol. To cope with channel dynamics, we design an adaptation mechanism to maximize the goodput with a satisfying SER. We further extend WiRa to one- to-many transmission scenario by concurrently emulating LoRa chirps in different RUs. We implement a prototype of WiRa on the USRP platform and commodity LoRa device. Experiments demonstrate WiRa can efficiently transmit complete LoRa frames with the throughput of 40.037kbps and the SER lower than 0.1.

While capable of achieving accurate identification in a single domain (i.e., training and testing in the same consistent WiFi environment), it would become extremely tough when WiFi environments change significantly. As such, domain adversarial neural networks-based approaches have been proposed to han- dle such diversities across domains, yet often found to share the same limitation in practice: the imbalance between high-capacity of feature extractors and data insufficiency of source domains. This article proposes i-Sample, an intermediate sample generation-based framework, striving to tackle this issue for WiFi-based HAR. i-Sample is mainly designed as two-stage training, where four data augmen- tation operations are proposed to train a coarse domain-invariant feature extractor in the first stage. In the second stage, we leverage the gradients of classification error to generate intermediate samples to refine the classifiers together with original samples, making i-Sample also capable to be integrated into most domain adversarial adaptation methods without neural netwo...},

 abstract = {underpinning for a myriad of emerging applications in the ﬁeld of human-computer interaction, mobile computing, and smart grid. Besides the utilization of up-to-date sensing techniques, modern activity recognition systems also require a machine learning (ML) algorithm that leverages the sensory data for identiﬁcation purposes. In view of the unique characteristics of the measure- ment data and the ML challenges thereof, we propose a non- intrusive human activity recognition system that only uses exist- ing commodity WiFi routers. The core of our system is a novel multiple kernel representation learning (MKRL) framework that automatically extracts and combines informative patterns from the Channel State Information (CSI) measurements. The MKRL ﬁrstly learns a kernel string representation from time, frequency, wavelet, and shape domains with an efﬁcient greedy algorithm. Then it performs information fusion from diverse perspectives based on multi-view kernel learning. Moreover, different stages of MKRL can be seamlessly integrated into a multiple kernel learning framework to build up a robust and comprehensive activity classiﬁer. Extensive experiments are conducted in typical indoor environments and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system outperforms existing methods and achieves a 98% activity recognition accuracy.},
